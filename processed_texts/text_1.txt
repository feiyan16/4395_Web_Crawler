We're gonna have a surprise guest and FOC is Monday for
.
And here's where I get into the things that I hope for in the next one and the things they could maybe tweak I love the idea that the second movie might be something that's like a blend of
,
and the
game (I love those games).
And that makes him happy, being a symbol of the best of us that way.
It gave me vibes of a lot of things, like I do feel there was a spiritual connection to a lot of things that I love in Batman and some of the stuff we did, especially in
—that feel of him being DIY, young, the Batcave being this remade train station (I hope they show more of the Batcave next movie).
Also, we have a class!
I know that sounds ridiculous coming from me, like an empty gesture, but my family does try and donate regularly to a bunch of causes that we believe in.
And there were nods to the kind of violence that we see nowadays and yet he still felt comic booky.
I didn't like the end of
where he got married and left.
So, I actually thought him and Catwoman was a huge plus and I really enjoyed it even though I was bracing against it because generally those aren't my favorite Batman stories.
And, obviously, I loved the fact that it reminded me of
and
with the flooding of Gotham, which hopefully they carry into the second movie.
I would much rather a crazy take that I don't agree with than a boring take.
So, huge, huge week next week—Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, this coming Monday, is FOC (Final Order Cutoff) for
, which is
my favorite issue so far.
And it's also the week that we're releasing
#5, which is one of my favorite issues of the series from me and
where the big secret of the whole series is revealed.
It cuts to your heart when you see a Batman movie because you spent so much time loving this character and being there and putting all your emotions and your feelings and your thoughts into him that you're worried that you're going to watch something and it's going to be rough, but it was amazing.
But a week from Friday, I'm going away with my 15 year-old for a father-son trip to Colorado, which I cannot wait for.
I want him to be mobile and tactile and fun and fast
scrappy and wild, a young Batman that’s doing things you haven't seen before that's high tech but nimble, like fast and agile, all of that.
I know Robert Pattinson isn't as young as he used to be, but he plays young and with that black makeup and the soundtrack, even though those are my songs,
by Nirvana and all that, it felt younger.
I also loved the references to Hush.
And I was like, “that's in my first issue of
with Greg Capullo, oh my God!”
The other thing was the last line.
Have a cape he can take off and throw instead of a collared cloak thing, you know what I mean?
That's just my take.
And I do that with my 10 year old too, that's why we went to Cooperstown a couple of weeks ago.
And, crazy,
comes out
with big extras from Dark Horse Comics.
Greg and I are celebrating by doing a signing at Midtown Comics.
I was very worried, and I didn't want to see it at the premiere, I wanted to see it with my kids because, again, it's been, like, 10 years since a solo Batman movie.
Of course, I'm partial to them using the Court of Owls.
I felt like he wouldn't be able to do that without coming back, but that's me.
He felt scrappy with his hands taped and the whole thing.
Instead of scaring bad people into the shadows, you bring good people out into the light in these dangerous times.
But what I'd like to do, at the very least, is include places that I've donated to, or that I feel deserve your support, at the end of different newsletters when the time feels right from now on.
Also, I thought that Zoë Kravitz was great as Catwoman.
And this one, to me, had
.
And if that's your bag, good on you, and that's your version of Batman and I respect that, it's just not mine.
And for me, that makes him happy.
Don't be afraid of having, like, the sleeveless or the purple gloves.
But I thought a fun topic for today would be
because I saw
and I… loved it.
So, having Gotham be wildly different and new and something that's yours as a new viewer and as a new generation of Batman fans where it's overgrown and strange and different areas and zones are cordoned off and different villains have them, I
that.
All the material goes in for the potential TV show in a couple of weeks and then we wait and see if it becomes anything.
We haven't been to a store signing in
.
That's what I would do if I was structuring it.
What I would do is in movie #2, Batman needs the help of, or goes to Arkham to consult, villains about the Court of Owls or about Clayface and whatever.
Huge congrats to Matt Reeves, Rob Pattinson, Paul Dano, Zoë Kravitz, everybody involved.
Emmett is 10 and Jack is 15, old enough to see it, so we all went with our neighbors and our friends and had a big party.
I think he could be great.
That's insane to me.
I wanted a young Batman after years of grizzled, older Batman, which I love too, but it's time to switch it up.
That's just me and that's just my version of Batman.
And on Tuesday and Wednesday we have big comics coming out—
#5 and
#1.
We're really grateful for all the support you guys have shown this book and we can't wait to share it with you.
Yes, because it's Tuesday, not Monday—Sorry, Quinn has a cold and he is going through a sleep regression because he started the big boy room at daycare where he's one of the younger kids.
This is where Blacktop Bill comes to shine.
The argument that “he is not happy, why doesn’t he deserve to be happy?” He
happy.
Love the Batmobile, favorite moment in the movie.
And again, collaboration.
But also, I want to see him be more
.
So, it's more just that it's so telegraphed, but I thought they did a fantastic job with it and I thought she was great.
I think Clayface could be redone in a
exciting way, especially in these times with all kinds of science-based stuff and also the idea of identity, all of it.
Have batarang things that pop out of his head, have him be able to detach the ears and throw them off the costume.
I loved it.
I want someone to come in and swing for the fence, always.
I love the fact that, and it was above all my favorite things, it was a
Batman—that he felt like he was built for my kids.
—Greg and I will show you a good time.
I hope they use Clayface, for example.
I think there are tons of versions of Batman where that's, like, bread and butter and that's amazing.
Not to connect it to that, but I mean, the words are in the comic about how he realizes he needs to be a symbol of hope, a symbol of inspiration, not a symbol of darkness.
If you like the series at all, you're gonna really love this one.
If I was writing it, they’d come in and say “now Gotham is ours to reshape…” That would be amazing.
Big week over here at Best Jackett.
And not because we did it—think Paul Pope’s
, that kind of a design.
I will be totally honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Catwoman-Batman relationships.
So, yeah, huge week next week!
I loved the way Gotham looked.
I genuinely believe
of Batman—not yours, necessarily—my version of Batman is happy.
Like, I love the way he looked in this one.
So, that's just my opinion.
Before we get going, I just wanted to send love and support to the people of Ukraine.
And so, they were too young to go see
,
, any of that stuff.
It was fucking great.
No posts
For me, I loved that they used the last line—the
is where Alfred says to Julie Madison, “I'm sorry, but he's spoken for…” And in this movie when Catwoman said, “I know you're spoken for,” I was like “oh, my heart…”
So, anyway, thank you guys so much!
And I love the emotional thing they were trying to say at the end of the movie, which I think was literally the messenger from
almost word for word.
I mean, I don't say I love something when I didn't love it, but I
it.
Other versions of Batman I completely respect, and again, it's not that one is better than the other, it's just my take my take.
Other things I loved… Penguin, I loved the down and dirty aspect of the villains, I thought Riddler was super cool and I love the way he felt threatening and modern.
So, yeah, those are my initial thoughts.
I love the suit now, I think it's really cool and I love the arm arrows.
He’s happy married to Gotham.
I always usually say three acts, but I thought they pulled it off here.
So, all the power to you if you have a different one.
The only thing I'd say is I hope they continue to be more and more ambitious.
It was unique, it was different, it felt coherent.
I want to see him be fast and more
than armor.
I hope they use a villain that they haven't used yet.
Go support it!
So, come celebrate with us, it'll be a blast.
We haven't been away in a few years and we used to take father-son trips regularly when he made it into the National History Bee and stuff like that.
Of course, I was super in the bag for the film the second the contact lens popped up 10 minutes.
Click the link we sent to , or
.
I love the fourth act, even though I'm not usually up for fourth acts in a movie.
He felt
, and that's what I wanted.
When it's done well, I'm always there for it, but I just feel like it falls into the same pattern over and over again: they can't be together in the present, they get close, and then they fall apart.
Anyway, back to comics.
So, getting married and having kids, to me, I've never felt that with my version of Batman.
But he has been not sleeping well, so I am
the most cogent person right now.
Not encumbered with that whole dark, black stuff.
So, I love the process, I love the people in the room, I love the people we're working with, so here's to that.
If you have any questions or you want to bring up anything to me, do it.

Hey guys, it's Scott.
So, there are a lot of places that I and we at Best Jackett have come to be proud of supporting over the last couple years, from
,
,
, and places that offer relief for refugees, things that I'd like to at least give you an opportunity to look at, so should you choose.
Give him, like, a more punkish, out-there young Batman feel.
Tyler will include
, so please, please, come see us!
That's the thing about the Catwoman story, I'll say this and then I'll stop.
We've been to a couple conventions here and there, but we have not done a store signing together, I don't know, I think since we went to Vegas in, like, 2019 or something?
But things are opening up for me, we hand in the final drafts of our screenplays and all of this for
.
It was like making Batman cool, and I loved that about it.
It was a perfect blend, to me, of an artistic vision where it had a visual aesthetic that reminded me of comics without feeling corny, and I thought it was just really well calibrated.
I thought it was really masterful.
I've been amazed by the clips of the cast and crew talking about the Court of Owls so much (Tyler put in the clips!)
Make him
.
Have a Batcycle that, like, literally hangs upside down in a configuration and then unfolds and, wham, high-tech Batcycle right there for you.
Bye!
But what I love most about a Batman take is
.
So, so great to see that.
It's a great film.
I make my political leanings pretty obvious on Twitter and I've always tried to be open about the things that I believe in and balance that with the belief that social media is a
place for for any kind of robust political discussion.
I would tweak it a little bit, but I think you could move into the next one being even a little bit more radical with his costume, because you've proved its true to core
it fits the story, you know what I'm saying?
They were probably behind some of the Riddler stuff, right?

For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.
And I'll tell you what I loved about it, I'll tell you what I hope for the next one that could maybe be slightly tweaked.
10 years!
And he has a family that he's built because they're inspired by what he's doing and he's inspired by them.
I hope you enjoyed it, I hope you go see it.
It felt
.
Oh my god, tomorrow, right?
And he loves it and he goes in proud of wearing his little backpack and all that comes out happy, talking about how he pee-pee’d on the potty.
We have a class in two nights—or in one night.
So, thanks, guys.
And then in the
movie you bring in the Joker.
He is happy going out every night and doing the thing that he thinks prevents what happened to him from happening to another child.
So, again, I want this to be a place that you can come to for creative discussions, for discussions about comics, for discussions about craft, for discussions about
history in the industry, for things that are coming up, all kinds of thoughts about the creative process and how it relates to engaging with the world around you so that you can go and make things that matter to you, whether they're openly political, whether they’re subversively political, whatever they are.
And I do think they would be the perfect villains for a destroyed Gotham, because that's when they would swoop in.
You get to know those villains, and then in #3 all bets are off and Joker comes in.
I really would love to see a suit that isn't black and armored.
Love the Batmobile, favorite moment in the movie.
And then in the
movie you bring in the Joker.

Also, we have a class!
And here's where I get into the things that I hope for in the next one and the things they could maybe tweak I love the idea that the second movie might be something that's like a blend of
,
and the
game (I love those games).
I think Clayface could be redone in a
exciting way, especially in these times with all kinds of science-based stuff and also the idea of identity, all of it.
It was unique, it was different, it felt coherent.
Not encumbered with that whole dark, black stuff.
Of course, I'm partial to them using the Court of Owls.
It cuts to your heart when you see a Batman movie because you spent so much time loving this character and being there and putting all your emotions and your feelings and your thoughts into him that you're worried that you're going to watch something and it's going to be rough, but it was amazing.
And it's also the week that we're releasing
#5, which is one of my favorite issues of the series from me and
where the big secret of the whole series is revealed.
Other versions of Batman I completely respect, and again, it's not that one is better than the other, it's just my take my take.
I want someone to come in and swing for the fence, always.
But a week from Friday, I'm going away with my 15 year-old for a father-son trip to Colorado, which I cannot wait for.
But things are opening up for me, we hand in the final drafts of our screenplays and all of this for
.
So, having Gotham be wildly different and new and something that's yours as a new viewer and as a new generation of Batman fans where it's overgrown and strange and different areas and zones are cordoned off and different villains have them, I
that.
He felt scrappy with his hands taped and the whole thing.
And I was like, “that's in my first issue of
with Greg Capullo, oh my God!”
The other thing was the last line.
I will be totally honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Catwoman-Batman relationships.
Make him
.
Oh my god, tomorrow, right?
I genuinely believe
of Batman—not yours, necessarily—my version of Batman is happy.
Have a cape he can take off and throw instead of a collared cloak thing, you know what I mean?
And I'll tell you what I loved about it, I'll tell you what I hope for the next one that could maybe be slightly tweaked.
He’s happy married to Gotham.
They were probably behind some of the Riddler stuff, right?
When it's done well, I'm always there for it, but I just feel like it falls into the same pattern over and over again: they can't be together in the present, they get close, and then they fall apart.
I know that sounds ridiculous coming from me, like an empty gesture, but my family does try and donate regularly to a bunch of causes that we believe in.
I love the fourth act, even though I'm not usually up for fourth acts in a movie.
The argument that “he is not happy, why doesn’t he deserve to be happy?” He
happy.
So, getting married and having kids, to me, I've never felt that with my version of Batman.
Have a Batcycle that, like, literally hangs upside down in a configuration and then unfolds and, wham, high-tech Batcycle right there for you.
If you have any questions or you want to bring up anything to me, do it.
Yes, because it's Tuesday, not Monday—Sorry, Quinn has a cold and he is going through a sleep regression because he started the big boy room at daycare where he's one of the younger kids.
Other things I loved… Penguin, I loved the down and dirty aspect of the villains, I thought Riddler was super cool and I love the way he felt threatening and modern.
Greg and I are celebrating by doing a signing at Midtown Comics.
For me, I loved that they used the last line—the
is where Alfred says to Julie Madison, “I'm sorry, but he's spoken for…” And in this movie when Catwoman said, “I know you're spoken for,” I was like “oh, my heart…”
So, anyway, thank you guys so much!
Click the link we sent to , or
.
That's just my take.
But what I love most about a Batman take is
.
The only thing I'd say is I hope they continue to be more and more ambitious.
And if that's your bag, good on you, and that's your version of Batman and I respect that, it's just not mine.
It felt
.
It gave me vibes of a lot of things, like I do feel there was a spiritual connection to a lot of things that I love in Batman and some of the stuff we did, especially in
—that feel of him being DIY, young, the Batcave being this remade train station (I hope they show more of the Batcave next movie).
And that makes him happy, being a symbol of the best of us that way.
So, that's just my opinion.
I hope they use a villain that they haven't used yet.
So, again, I want this to be a place that you can come to for creative discussions, for discussions about comics, for discussions about craft, for discussions about
history in the industry, for things that are coming up, all kinds of thoughts about the creative process and how it relates to engaging with the world around you so that you can go and make things that matter to you, whether they're openly political, whether they’re subversively political, whatever they are.
We've been to a couple conventions here and there, but we have not done a store signing together, I don't know, I think since we went to Vegas in, like, 2019 or something?
Not to connect it to that, but I mean, the words are in the comic about how he realizes he needs to be a symbol of hope, a symbol of inspiration, not a symbol of darkness.
I would tweak it a little bit, but I think you could move into the next one being even a little bit more radical with his costume, because you've proved its true to core
it fits the story, you know what I'm saying?
10 years!
All the material goes in for the potential TV show in a couple of weeks and then we wait and see if it becomes anything.
And this one, to me, had

So, I actually thought him and Catwoman was a huge plus and I really enjoyed it even though I was bracing against it because generally those aren't my favorite Batman stories.
And, crazy,
comes out
with big extras from Dark Horse Comics.
I love the fact that, and it was above all my favorite things, it was a
Batman—that he felt like he was built for my kids.

Hey guys, it's Scott.
You get to know those villains, and then in #3 all bets are off and Joker comes in.
And on Tuesday and Wednesday we have big comics coming out—
#5 and
#1.
I think there are tons of versions of Batman where that's, like, bread and butter and that's amazing.
And, obviously, I loved the fact that it reminded me of
and
with the flooding of Gotham, which hopefully they carry into the second movie.
This is where Blacktop Bill comes to shine.
So, yeah, those are my initial thoughts.
So, yeah, huge week next week!
But what I'd like to do, at the very least, is include places that I've donated to, or that I feel deserve your support, at the end of different newsletters when the time feels right from now on.
Don't be afraid of having, like, the sleeveless or the purple gloves.
Have batarang things that pop out of his head, have him be able to detach the ears and throw them off the costume.
So, there are a lot of places that I and we at Best Jackett have come to be proud of supporting over the last couple years, from
,
,
, and places that offer relief for refugees, things that I'd like to at least give you an opportunity to look at, so should you choose.
And for me, that makes him happy.
I love the suit now, I think it's really cool and I love the arm arrows.
So, come celebrate with us, it'll be a blast.
Emmett is 10 and Jack is 15, old enough to see it, so we all went with our neighbors and our friends and had a big party.
And there were nods to the kind of violence that we see nowadays and yet he still felt comic booky.
Big week over here at Best Jackett.
I want to see him be fast and more
than armor.
I want him to be mobile and tactile and fun and fast
scrappy and wild, a young Batman that’s doing things you haven't seen before that's high tech but nimble, like fast and agile, all of that.
If you like the series at all, you're gonna really love this one.
I didn't like the end of
where he got married and left.
I really would love to see a suit that isn't black and armored.
We're gonna have a surprise guest and FOC is Monday for
.
So, it's more just that it's so telegraphed, but I thought they did a fantastic job with it and I thought she was great.
I always usually say three acts, but I thought they pulled it off here.
I loved it.
That's the thing about the Catwoman story, I'll say this and then I'll stop.
That's just me and that's just my version of Batman.

Also, I thought that Zoë Kravitz was great as Catwoman.
I felt like he wouldn't be able to do that without coming back, but that's me.
I hope you enjoyed it, I hope you go see it.
We have a class in two nights—or in one night.
And again, collaboration.
And I do think they would be the perfect villains for a destroyed Gotham, because that's when they would swoop in.
Love the Batmobile, favorite moment in the movie.
I wanted a young Batman after years of grizzled, older Batman, which I love too, but it's time to switch it up.
I mean, I don't say I love something when I didn't love it, but I
it.
—Greg and I will show you a good time.
Before we get going, I just wanted to send love and support to the people of Ukraine.
Tyler will include
, so please, please, come see us!
Give him, like, a more punkish, out-there young Batman feel.
So, I love the process, I love the people in the room, I love the people we're working with, so here's to that.
And I do that with my 10 year old too, that's why we went to Cooperstown a couple of weeks ago.
I loved the way Gotham looked.
I think he could be great.
Emmett is 10 and Jack is 15, old enough to see it, so we all went with our neighbors and our friends and had a big party.

It was a perfect blend, to me, of an artistic vision where it had a visual aesthetic that reminded me of comics without feeling corny, and I thought it was just really well calibrated.

We haven't been away in a few years and we used to take father-son trips regularly when he made it into the National History Bee and stuff like that.
Not encumbered with that whole dark, black stuff.
What I would do is in movie #2, Batman needs the help of, or goes to Arkham to consult, villains about the Court of Owls or about Clayface and whatever.
For me, I loved that they used the last line—the

But also, I want to see him be more
.
It was fucking great.
If you have any questions or you want to bring up anything to me, do it.
But he has been not sleeping well, so I am
the most cogent person right now.
And I do that with my 10 year old too, that's why we went to Cooperstown a couple of weeks ago.
I also loved the references to Hush.
I know Robert Pattinson isn't as young as he used to be, but he plays young and with that black makeup and the soundtrack, even though those are my songs,
by Nirvana and all that, it felt younger.
But things are opening up for me, we hand in the final drafts of our screenplays and all of this for

I make my political leanings pretty obvious on Twitter and I've always tried to be open about the things that I believe in and balance that with the belief that social media is a
place for for any kind of robust political discussion.
I've been amazed by the clips of the cast and crew talking about the Court of Owls so much (Tyler put in the clips!)
Not to connect it to that, but I mean, the words are in the comic about how he realizes he needs to be a symbol of hope, a symbol of inspiration, not a symbol of darkness.
So, yeah, huge week next week!

It was like making Batman cool, and I loved that about it.
And if that's your bag, good on you, and that's your version of Batman and I respect that, it's just not mine.
I thought it was really masterful.
I want him to be mobile and tactile and fun and fast
scrappy and wild, a young Batman that’s doing things you haven't seen before that's high tech but nimble, like fast and agile, all of that.
And so, they were too young to go see

, any of that stuff.
Have a cape he can take off and throw instead of a collared cloak thing, you know what I mean?
And I do think they would be the perfect villains for a destroyed Gotham, because that's when they would swoop in.
And he loves it and he goes in proud of wearing his little backpack and all that comes out happy, talking about how he pee-pee’d on the potty.
And for me, that makes him happy.
I think there are tons of versions of Batman where that's, like, bread and butter and that's amazing.
10 years!
Love the Batmobile, favorite moment in the movie.
That's insane to me.
I think he could be great.
Anyway, back to comics.
Instead of scaring bad people into the shadows, you bring good people out into the light in these dangerous times.
I loved it.
But I thought a fun topic for today would be
because I saw
and I… loved it.
It felt

Have batarang things that pop out of his head, have him be able to detach the ears and throw them off the costume.
The only thing I'd say is I hope they continue to be more and more ambitious.
And, obviously, I loved the fact that it reminded me of

So, all the power to you if you have a different one.
So, having Gotham be wildly different and new and something that's yours as a new viewer and as a new generation of Batman fans where it's overgrown and strange and different areas and zones are cordoned off and different villains have them, I
that.

exciting way, especially in these times with all kinds of science-based stuff and also the idea of identity, all of it.
I wanted a young Batman after years of grizzled, older Batman, which I love too, but it's time to switch it up.
And then in the
movie you bring in the Joker.
Click the link we sent to , or

And I love the emotional thing they were trying to say at the end of the movie, which I think was literally the messenger from
almost word for word.
I hope you enjoyed it, I hope you go see it.
Of course, I was super in the bag for the film the second the contact lens popped up 10 minutes.

And here's where I get into the things that I hope for in the next one and the things they could maybe tweak I love the idea that the second movie might be something that's like a blend of
,
and the
game (I love those games).
—Greg and I will show you a good time.
When it's done well, I'm always there for it, but I just feel like it falls into the same pattern over and over again: they can't be together in the present, they get close, and then they fall apart.
Instead of scaring bad people into the shadows, you bring good people out into the light in these dangerous times.
It was like making Batman cool, and I loved that about it.
And then in the
movie you bring in the Joker.
But what I love most about a Batman take is
.
He felt
, and that's what I wanted.
So, so great to see that.
The argument that “he is not happy, why doesn’t he deserve to be happy?” He
happy.
Big week over here at Best Jackett.
It's a great film.
I will be totally honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Catwoman-Batman relationships.
I genuinely believe
of Batman—not yours, necessarily—my version of Batman is happy.
Other versions of Batman I completely respect, and again, it's not that one is better than the other, it's just my take my take.
It was a perfect blend, to me, of an artistic vision where it had a visual aesthetic that reminded me of comics without feeling corny, and I thought it was just really well calibrated.
I didn't like the end of
where he got married and left.
And if that's your bag, good on you, and that's your version of Batman and I respect that, it's just not mine.
He’s happy married to Gotham.

Hey guys, it's Scott.
I wanted a young Batman after years of grizzled, older Batman, which I love too, but it's time to switch it up.
And again, collaboration.
The only thing I'd say is I hope they continue to be more and more ambitious.
We've been to a couple conventions here and there, but we have not done a store signing together, I don't know, I think since we went to Vegas in, like, 2019 or something?
I loved it.
I've been amazed by the clips of the cast and crew talking about the Court of Owls so much (Tyler put in the clips!)
But he has been not sleeping well, so I am
the most cogent person right now.
Also, I thought that Zoë Kravitz was great as Catwoman.
I want to see him be fast and more
than armor.
Go support it!
I know that sounds ridiculous coming from me, like an empty gesture, but my family does try and donate regularly to a bunch of causes that we believe in.
I love the suit now, I think it's really cool and I love the arm arrows.
I would tweak it a little bit, but I think you could move into the next one being even a little bit more radical with his costume, because you've proved its true to core
it fits the story, you know what I'm saying?
But what I'd like to do, at the very least, is include places that I've donated to, or that I feel deserve your support, at the end of different newsletters when the time feels right from now on.
Greg and I are celebrating by doing a signing at Midtown Comics.
But things are opening up for me, we hand in the final drafts of our screenplays and all of this for
.
I hope they use a villain that they haven't used yet.
I hope they use Clayface, for example.
And so, they were too young to go see
,
, any of that stuff.
If you have any questions or you want to bring up anything to me, do it.
We haven't been away in a few years and we used to take father-son trips regularly when he made it into the National History Bee and stuff like that.
Of course, I'm partial to them using the Court of Owls.
I want someone to come in and swing for the fence, always.
And on Tuesday and Wednesday we have big comics coming out—
#5 and
#1.
But I thought a fun topic for today would be
because I saw
and I… loved it.
Like, I love the way he looked in this one.
Tyler will include
, so please, please, come see us!
This is where Blacktop Bill comes to shine.
That's the thing about the Catwoman story, I'll say this and then I'll stop.
I thought it was really masterful.
I know Robert Pattinson isn't as young as he used to be, but he plays young and with that black makeup and the soundtrack, even though those are my songs,
by Nirvana and all that, it felt younger.
That's just me and that's just my version of Batman.
I love the fact that, and it was above all my favorite things, it was a
Batman—that he felt like he was built for my kids.
I want him to be mobile and tactile and fun and fast
scrappy and wild, a young Batman that’s doing things you haven't seen before that's high tech but nimble, like fast and agile, all of that.
And I was like, “that's in my first issue of
with Greg Capullo, oh my God!”
The other thing was the last line.
They were probably behind some of the Riddler stuff, right?
And, obviously, I loved the fact that it reminded me of
and
with the flooding of Gotham, which hopefully they carry into the second movie.
And he loves it and he goes in proud of wearing his little backpack and all that comes out happy, talking about how he pee-pee’d on the potty.
So, huge, huge week next week—Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, this coming Monday, is FOC (Final Order Cutoff) for
, which is
my favorite issue so far.
So, again, I want this to be a place that you can come to for creative discussions, for discussions about comics, for discussions about craft, for discussions about
history in the industry, for things that are coming up, all kinds of thoughts about the creative process and how it relates to engaging with the world around you so that you can go and make things that matter to you, whether they're openly political, whether they’re subversively political, whatever they are.
So, I love the process, I love the people in the room, I love the people we're working with, so here's to that.
Other things I loved… Penguin, I loved the down and dirty aspect of the villains, I thought Riddler was super cool and I love the way he felt threatening and modern.
I really would love to see a suit that isn't black and armored.
Oh my god, tomorrow, right?
And he has a family that he's built because they're inspired by what he's doing and he's inspired by them.
10 years!
And it's also the week that we're releasing
#5, which is one of my favorite issues of the series from me and
where the big secret of the whole series is revealed.
I always usually say three acts, but I thought they pulled it off here.
