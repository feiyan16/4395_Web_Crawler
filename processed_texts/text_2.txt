Robert Pattinson Wasn't Bothered by Initial Backlash Over The Batman Casting

And, obviously, I loved the fact that it reminded me of

with the flooding of Gotham, which hopefully they carry into the second movie.
I would much rather a crazy take that I don't agree with than a boring take.
And, crazy,
comes out
with big extras from Dark Horse Comics.
For me, I loved that they used the last line—the
is where Alfred says to Julie Madison, “I'm sorry, but he's spoken for…” And in this movie when Catwoman said, “I know you're spoken for,” I was like “oh, my heart…”
So, anyway, thank you guys so much!
Don't be afraid of having, like, the sleeveless or the purple gloves.

It cuts to your heart when you see a Batman movie because you spent so much time loving this character and being there and putting all your emotions and your feelings and your thoughts into him that you're worried that you're going to watch something and it's going to be rough, but it was amazing.
So, that's just my opinion.
And I'll tell you what I loved about it, I'll tell you what I hope for the next one that could maybe be slightly tweaked.
If you have any questions or you want to bring up anything to me, do it.
Before we get going, I just wanted to send love and support to the people of Ukraine.
I hope they use a villain that they haven't used yet.
So, thanks, guys.
I also loved the references to Hush.
We've been to a couple conventions here and there, but we have not done a store signing together, I don't know, I think since we went to Vegas in, like, 2019 or something?
Tyler will include
, so please, please, come see us!
I think there are tons of versions of Batman where that's, like, bread and butter and that's amazing.
I know that sounds ridiculous coming from me, like an empty gesture, but my family does try and donate regularly to a bunch of causes that we believe in.
And I do that with my 10 year old too, that's why we went to Cooperstown a couple of weeks ago.
I hope you enjoyed it, I hope you go see it.
I loved it.
I felt like he wouldn't be able to do that without coming back, but that's me.
It was like making Batman cool, and I loved that about it.
They were probably behind some of the Riddler stuff, right?
It was unique, it was different, it felt coherent.

Hey guys, it's Scott.
But a week from Friday, I'm going away with my 15 year-old for a father-son trip to Colorado, which I cannot wait for.
Yes, because it's Tuesday, not Monday—Sorry, Quinn has a cold and he is going through a sleep regression because he started the big boy room at daycare where he's one of the younger kids.
We have a class in two nights—or in one night.
I mean, I don't say I love something when I didn't love it, but I
it.
Have a cape he can take off and throw instead of a collared cloak thing, you know what I mean?
He felt
, and that's what I wanted.
So, all the power to you if you have a different one.
That's the thing about the Catwoman story, I'll say this and then I'll stop.
I know Robert Pattinson isn't as young as he used to be, but he plays young and with that black makeup and the soundtrack, even though those are my songs,
by Nirvana and all that, it felt younger.
And I love the emotional thing they were trying to say at the end of the movie, which I think was literally the messenger from
almost word for word.
And again, collaboration.
It's a great film.
I love the fact that, and it was above all my favorite things, it was a
Batman—that he felt like he was built for my kids.
I really would love to see a suit that isn't black and armored.
So, getting married and having kids, to me, I've never felt that with my version of Batman.
Oh my god, tomorrow, right?
When it's done well, I'm always there for it, but I just feel like it falls into the same pattern over and over again: they can't be together in the present, they get close, and then they fall apart.
He’s happy married to Gotham.
But what I'd like to do, at the very least, is include places that I've donated to, or that I feel deserve your support, at the end of different newsletters when the time feels right from now on.
And I do think they would be the perfect villains for a destroyed Gotham, because that's when they would swoop in.
No posts
I've been amazed by the clips of the cast and crew talking about the Court of Owls so much (Tyler put in the clips!)
Other versions of Batman I completely respect, and again, it's not that one is better than the other, it's just my take my take.
And there were nods to the kind of violence that we see nowadays and yet he still felt comic booky.
But he has been not sleeping well, so I am
the most cogent person right now.
And then in the
movie you bring in the Joker.
The argument that “he is not happy, why doesn’t he deserve to be happy?” He
happy.
I didn't like the end of
where he got married and left.
I make my political leanings pretty obvious on Twitter and I've always tried to be open about the things that I believe in and balance that with the belief that social media is a
place for for any kind of robust political discussion.
And so, they were too young to go see
,
, any of that stuff.
Make him
.
So, yeah, those are my initial thoughts.
So, yeah, huge week next week!
Love the Batmobile, favorite moment in the movie.
Also, I thought that Zoë Kravitz was great as Catwoman.
I hope they use Clayface, for example.
We're gonna have a surprise guest and FOC is Monday for
.
I thought it was really masterful.
It gave me vibes of a lot of things, like I do feel there was a spiritual connection to a lot of things that I love in Batman and some of the stuff we did, especially in
—that feel of him being DIY, young, the Batcave being this remade train station (I hope they show more of the Batcave next movie).
And that makes him happy, being a symbol of the best of us that way.
Have batarang things that pop out of his head, have him be able to detach the ears and throw them off the costume.
That's what I would do if I was structuring it.
Also, we have a class!
And he loves it and he goes in proud of wearing his little backpack and all that comes out happy, talking about how he pee-pee’d on the potty.
The only thing I'd say is I hope they continue to be more and more ambitious.
So, I love the process, I love the people in the room, I love the people we're working with, so here's to that.
So, again, I want this to be a place that you can come to for creative discussions, for discussions about comics, for discussions about craft, for discussions about
history in the industry, for things that are coming up, all kinds of thoughts about the creative process and how it relates to engaging with the world around you so that you can go and make things that matter to you, whether they're openly political, whether they’re subversively political, whatever they are.
And not because we did it—think Paul Pope’s
, that kind of a design.
I wanted a young Batman after years of grizzled, older Batman, which I love too, but it's time to switch it up.
10 years!
We haven't been to a store signing in
.
I would tweak it a little bit, but I think you could move into the next one being even a little bit more radical with his costume, because you've proved its true to core
it fits the story, you know what I'm saying?
He felt scrappy with his hands taped and the whole thing.
So, come celebrate with us, it'll be a blast.
And here's where I get into the things that I hope for in the next one and the things they could maybe tweak I love the idea that the second movie might be something that's like a blend of
,
and the
game (I love those games).
Instead of scaring bad people into the shadows, you bring good people out into the light in these dangerous times.
If you like the series at all, you're gonna really love this one.
Have a Batcycle that, like, literally hangs upside down in a configuration and then unfolds and, wham, high-tech Batcycle right there for you.
And it's also the week that we're releasing
#5, which is one of my favorite issues of the series from me and
where the big secret of the whole series is revealed.
I was very worried, and I didn't want to see it at the premiere, I wanted to see it with my kids because, again, it's been, like, 10 years since a solo Batman movie.
I think he could be great.
I genuinely believe
of Batman—not yours, necessarily—my version of Batman is happy.
You get to know those villains, and then in #3 all bets are off and Joker comes in.
And for me, that makes him happy.
Greg and I are celebrating by doing a signing at Midtown Comics.
It felt
.
We haven't been away in a few years and we used to take father-son trips regularly when he made it into the National History Bee and stuff like that.
Of course, I was super in the bag for the film the second the contact lens popped up 10 minutes.
All the material goes in for the potential TV show in a couple of weeks and then we wait and see if it becomes anything.

But things are opening up for me, we hand in the final drafts of our screenplays and all of this for
.
But also, I want to see him be more
.
I want to see him be fast and more
than armor.
I want him to be mobile and tactile and fun and fast
scrappy and wild, a young Batman that’s doing things you haven't seen before that's high tech but nimble, like fast and agile, all of that.
Emmett is 10 and Jack is 15, old enough to see it, so we all went with our neighbors and our friends and had a big party.
I will be totally honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Catwoman-Batman relationships.
I love the fourth act, even though I'm not usually up for fourth acts in a movie.
But I thought a fun topic for today would be
because I saw
and I… loved it.
I think Clayface could be redone in a
exciting way, especially in these times with all kinds of science-based stuff and also the idea of identity, all of it.
So, I actually thought him and Catwoman was a huge plus and I really enjoyed it even though I was bracing against it because generally those aren't my favorite Batman stories.
And this one, to me, had
.
What I would do is in movie #2, Batman needs the help of, or goes to Arkham to consult, villains about the Court of Owls or about Clayface and whatever.
That's just my take.
So, having Gotham be wildly different and new and something that's yours as a new viewer and as a new generation of Batman fans where it's overgrown and strange and different areas and zones are cordoned off and different villains have them, I
that.
Huge congrats to Matt Reeves, Rob Pattinson, Paul Dano, Zoë Kravitz, everybody involved.
Not encumbered with that whole dark, black stuff.
It was fucking great.
And if that's your bag, good on you, and that's your version of Batman and I respect that, it's just not mine.
Not to connect it to that, but I mean, the words are in the comic about how he realizes he needs to be a symbol of hope, a symbol of inspiration, not a symbol of darkness.
So, so great to see that.
So, it's more just that it's so telegraphed, but I thought they did a fantastic job with it and I thought she was great.
I love the suit now, I think it's really cool and I love the arm arrows.
Anyway, back to comics.
And on Tuesday and Wednesday we have big comics coming out—
#5 and
#1.
So, huge, huge week next week—Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, this coming Monday, is FOC (Final Order Cutoff) for
, which is
my favorite issue so far.
Of course, I'm partial to them using the Court of Owls.
But what I love most about a Batman take is
.
And he has a family that he's built because they're inspired by what he's doing and he's inspired by them.
Bye!
This is where Blacktop Bill comes to shine.
Like, I love the way he looked in this one.
—Greg and I will show you a good time.
It was a perfect blend, to me, of an artistic vision where it had a visual aesthetic that reminded me of comics without feeling corny, and I thought it was just really well calibrated.
Go support it!
I always usually say three acts, but I thought they pulled it off here.
If I was writing it, they’d come in and say “now Gotham is ours to reshape…” That would be amazing.
Other things I loved… Penguin, I loved the down and dirty aspect of the villains, I thought Riddler was super cool and I love the way he felt threatening and modern.
He is happy going out every night and doing the thing that he thinks prevents what happened to him from happening to another child.
Big week over here at Best Jackett.
So, there are a lot of places that I and we at Best Jackett have come to be proud of supporting over the last couple years, from
,
,
, and places that offer relief for refugees, things that I'd like to at least give you an opportunity to look at, so should you choose.
We're really grateful for all the support you guys have shown this book and we can't wait to share it with you.
I loved the way Gotham looked.
That's insane to me.
Give him, like, a more punkish, out-there young Batman feel.
I want someone to come in and swing for the fence, always.
That's just me and that's just my version of Batman.
And I was like, “that's in my first issue of
with Greg Capullo, oh my God!”
The other thing was the last line.
If you like the series at all, you're gonna really love this one.
And here's where I get into the things that I hope for in the next one and the things they could maybe tweak I love the idea that the second movie might be something that's like a blend of
,
and the
game (I love those games).
So, thanks, guys.
Give him, like, a more punkish, out-there young Batman feel.
But I thought a fun topic for today would be
because I saw
and I… loved it.
Other versions of Batman I completely respect, and again, it's not that one is better than the other, it's just my take my take.
Also, I thought that Zoë Kravitz was great as Catwoman.
Anyway, back to comics.
I want someone to come in and swing for the fence, always.
It was fucking great.
I know that sounds ridiculous coming from me, like an empty gesture, but my family does try and donate regularly to a bunch of causes that we believe in.
We have a class in two nights—or in one night.
And, crazy,
comes out
with big extras from Dark Horse Comics.
I mean, I don't say I love something when I didn't love it, but I
it.
I've been amazed by the clips of the cast and crew talking about the Court of Owls so much (Tyler put in the clips!)
The only thing I'd say is I hope they continue to be more and more ambitious.
Big week over here at Best Jackett.
That's just my take.
It was like making Batman cool, and I loved that about it.
It's a great film.
So, having Gotham be wildly different and new and something that's yours as a new viewer and as a new generation of Batman fans where it's overgrown and strange and different areas and zones are cordoned off and different villains have them, I
that.
So, yeah, huge week next week!
I always usually say three acts, but I thought they pulled it off here.
We've been to a couple conventions here and there, but we have not done a store signing together, I don't know, I think since we went to Vegas in, like, 2019 or something?
I would much rather a crazy take that I don't agree with than a boring take.
But what I'd like to do, at the very least, is include places that I've donated to, or that I feel deserve your support, at the end of different newsletters when the time feels right from now on.
When it's done well, I'm always there for it, but I just feel like it falls into the same pattern over and over again: they can't be together in the present, they get close, and then they fall apart.
But he has been not sleeping well, so I am
the most cogent person right now.
They were probably behind some of the Riddler stuff, right?
No posts
Yes, because it's Tuesday, not Monday—Sorry, Quinn has a cold and he is going through a sleep regression because he started the big boy room at daycare where he's one of the younger kids.
Oh my god, tomorrow, right?
Emmett is 10 and Jack is 15, old enough to see it, so we all went with our neighbors and our friends and had a big party.
So, so great to see that.
And I love the emotional thing they were trying to say at the end of the movie, which I think was literally the messenger from
almost word for word.
All the material goes in for the potential TV show in a couple of weeks and then we wait and see if it becomes anything.
I felt like he wouldn't be able to do that without coming back, but that's me.
Love the Batmobile, favorite moment in the movie.
He’s happy married to Gotham.
The argument that “he is not happy, why doesn’t he deserve to be happy?” He
happy.
Like, I love the way he looked in this one.
I was very worried, and I didn't want to see it at the premiere, I wanted to see it with my kids because, again, it's been, like, 10 years since a solo Batman movie.
And I'll tell you what I loved about it, I'll tell you what I hope for the next one that could maybe be slightly tweaked.
So, yeah, those are my initial thoughts.
And if that's your bag, good on you, and that's your version of Batman and I respect that, it's just not mine.
So, I love the process, I love the people in the room, I love the people we're working with, so here's to that.
I thought it was really masterful.

Hey guys, it's Scott.
I hope you enjoyed it, I hope you go see it.
Before we get going, I just wanted to send love and support to the people of Ukraine.
I love the fourth act, even though I'm not usually up for fourth acts in a movie.
And so, they were too young to go see
,
, any of that stuff.
And it's also the week that we're releasing
#5, which is one of my favorite issues of the series from me and
where the big secret of the whole series is revealed.
10 years!
Also, we have a class!
Click the link we sent to , or

I know Robert Pattinson isn't as young as he used to be, but he plays young and with that black makeup and the soundtrack, even though those are my songs,
by Nirvana and all that, it felt younger.
I love the fact that, and it was above all my favorite things, it was a
Batman—that he felt like he was built for my kids.
It was a perfect blend, to me, of an artistic vision where it had a visual aesthetic that reminded me of comics without feeling corny, and I thought it was just really well calibrated.
Bye!
Not encumbered with that whole dark, black stuff.
I make my political leanings pretty obvious on Twitter and I've always tried to be open about the things that I believe in and balance that with the belief that social media is a
place for for any kind of robust political discussion.
Tyler will include
, so please, please, come see us!
I think Clayface could be redone in a
exciting way, especially in these times with all kinds of science-based stuff and also the idea of identity, all of it.
What I would do is in movie #2, Batman needs the help of, or goes to Arkham to consult, villains about the Court of Owls or about Clayface and whatever.
That's the thing about the Catwoman story, I'll say this and then I'll stop.
If I was writing it, they’d come in and say “now Gotham is ours to reshape…” That would be amazing.
Have a Batcycle that, like, literally hangs upside down in a configuration and then unfolds and, wham, high-tech Batcycle right there for you.
But things are opening up for me, we hand in the final drafts of our screenplays and all of this for
.
I want to see him be fast and more
than armor.
And he loves it and he goes in proud of wearing his little backpack and all that comes out happy, talking about how he pee-pee’d on the potty.
I loved the way Gotham looked.
He felt
, and that's what I wanted.
That's insane to me.
So, I actually thought him and Catwoman was a huge plus and I really enjoyed it even though I was bracing against it because generally those aren't my favorite Batman stories.
He felt scrappy with his hands taped and the whole thing.
We're gonna have a surprise guest and FOC is Monday for
.
So, getting married and having kids, to me, I've never felt that with my version of Batman.
That's just me and that's just my version of Batman.
If you have any questions or you want to bring up anything to me, do it.
For me, I loved that they used the last line—the
is where Alfred says to Julie Madison, “I'm sorry, but he's spoken for…” And in this movie when Catwoman said, “I know you're spoken for,” I was like “oh, my heart…”
So, anyway, thank you guys so much!
You get to know those villains, and then in #3 all bets are off and Joker comes in.
We haven't been to a store signing in
.
I didn't like the end of
where he got married and left.
It felt
.
It gave me vibes of a lot of things, like I do feel there was a spiritual connection to a lot of things that I love in Batman and some of the stuff we did, especially in
—that feel of him being DIY, young, the Batcave being this remade train station (I hope they show more of the Batcave next movie).
So, huge, huge week next week—Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, this coming Monday, is FOC (Final Order Cutoff) for
, which is
my favorite issue so far.
I hope they use a villain that they haven't used yet.
Have a cape he can take off and throw instead of a collared cloak thing, you know what I mean?
And for me, that makes him happy.
I genuinely believe
of Batman—not yours, necessarily—my version of Batman is happy.
So, all the power to you if you have a different one.

I will be totally honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Catwoman-Batman relationships.
Not to connect it to that, but I mean, the words are in the comic about how he realizes he needs to be a symbol of hope, a symbol of inspiration, not a symbol of darkness.
And not because we did it—think Paul Pope’s
, that kind of a design.
And this one, to me, had
.
Greg and I are celebrating by doing a signing at Midtown Comics.
So, it's more just that it's so telegraphed, but I thought they did a fantastic job with it and I thought she was great.
But what I love most about a Batman take is
.
And then in the
movie you bring in the Joker.
Have batarang things that pop out of his head, have him be able to detach the ears and throw them off the costume.
I really would love to see a suit that isn't black and armored.
I think he could be great.
So, there are a lot of places that I and we at Best Jackett have come to be proud of supporting over the last couple years, from
,
,
, and places that offer relief for refugees, things that I'd like to at least give you an opportunity to look at, so should you choose.
We haven't been away in a few years and we used to take father-son trips regularly when he made it into the National History Bee and stuff like that.
I think there are tons of versions of Batman where that's, like, bread and butter and that's amazing.
I love the suit now, I think it's really cool and I love the arm arrows.
Of course, I was super in the bag for the film the second the contact lens popped up 10 minutes.
Huge congrats to Matt Reeves, Rob Pattinson, Paul Dano, Zoë Kravitz, everybody involved.
So, again, I want this to be a place that you can come to for creative discussions, for discussions about comics, for discussions about craft, for discussions about
history in the industry, for things that are coming up, all kinds of thoughts about the creative process and how it relates to engaging with the world around you so that you can go and make things that matter to you, whether they're openly political, whether they’re subversively political, whatever they are.
It was unique, it was different, it felt coherent.
And that makes him happy, being a symbol of the best of us that way.
It cuts to your heart when you see a Batman movie because you spent so much time loving this character and being there and putting all your emotions and your feelings and your thoughts into him that you're worried that you're going to watch something and it's going to be rough, but it was amazing.
Other things I loved… Penguin, I loved the down and dirty aspect of the villains, I thought Riddler was super cool and I love the way he felt threatening and modern.
And, obviously, I loved the fact that it reminded me of
and
with the flooding of Gotham, which hopefully they carry into the second movie.
But a week from Friday, I'm going away with my 15 year-old for a father-son trip to Colorado, which I cannot wait for.
That's what I would do if I was structuring it.
And I do think they would be the perfect villains for a destroyed Gotham, because that's when they would swoop in.
So, come celebrate with us, it'll be a blast.
And I was like, “that's in my first issue of
with Greg Capullo, oh my God!”
The other thing was the last line.
Make him
.
This is where Blacktop Bill comes to shine.
We're really grateful for all the support you guys have shown this book and we can't wait to share it with you.
And I do that with my 10 year old too, that's why we went to Cooperstown a couple of weeks ago.
I want him to be mobile and tactile and fun and fast
scrappy and wild, a young Batman that’s doing things you haven't seen before that's high tech but nimble, like fast and agile, all of that.
He is happy going out every night and doing the thing that he thinks prevents what happened to him from happening to another child.
Don't be afraid of having, like, the sleeveless or the purple gloves.
I hope they use Clayface, for example.
Go support it!
I would tweak it a little bit, but I think you could move into the next one being even a little bit more radical with his costume, because you've proved its true to core
it fits the story, you know what I'm saying?
I loved it.
And there were nods to the kind of violence that we see nowadays and yet he still felt comic booky.
And again, collaboration.
Of course, I'm partial to them using the Court of Owls.
Instead of scaring bad people into the shadows, you bring good people out into the light in these dangerous times.
But also, I want to see him be more
.
So, that's just my opinion.
I wanted a young Batman after years of grizzled, older Batman, which I love too, but it's time to switch it up.
—Greg and I will show you a good time.
I also loved the references to Hush.
And he has a family that he's built because they're inspired by what he's doing and he's inspired by them.
And on Tuesday and Wednesday we have big comics coming out—
#5 and
#1.
DC blockbuster is just the eighth film since theaters reopened — and fifth from Hollywood — to crack the half-billion mark
Warner Bros
After two weeks in theaters, Warner Bros./DC’s “The Batman” has passed $500 million at the global box office, with more than half of that total coming from domestic theaters.
In fact, the movie has yet to open in several key territories, including China, where it debuts Friday, March 18.
“We couldn’t be more thrilled to see people all over the world enjoying ‘The Batman’ in theaters.

“The Batman” also broke some pandemic records in territories including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Australia, Korea, Brazil, and Mexico.
On Wednesday, “The Batman” added $5.75 million domestically, bringing its total to $258.3 million in North America and $505.8 million worldwide.
The Matt Reeves film now stands as Warner’s highest-grossing theatrical release since theaters reopened, topping the $468 million of “Godzilla vs. Kong.”
It is also now the eighth movie since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and fifth from Hollywood, to reach the $500 million mark.
We congratulate Matt, Dylan, Walter, Chantal, Robert and Zoë, and the entire cast and crew on this wonderful benchmark,” Warner Bros. Pictures chairman Toby Emmerich said in a statement.
Matt Reeves directed “The Batman,” which stars Robert Pattinson, Andy Serkis, Zoë Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard and Colin Farrell.
“The Batman” also scored the biggest-ever debut for a DC film in seven markets and the biggest-ever opening weekend for a Warner Bros. Pictures release in Iceland.
“The Batman” joins post-shutdown record holder “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($1.87 billion), “No Time to Die” ($774 million), “F9” ($726 million), and “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” ($502 million), along with Chinese films “The Battle at Lake Changjin” ($902.5 million), “Hi, Mom” ($822 million) and “Detective Chinatown 3” ($686 million).
“The Batman” is set to keep rolling in big box office numbers in the second half of March.
Matt Reeves has delivered an extraordinary film that manages to honor the legacy of this global cultural hero while taking moviegoers into an experience that feels fresh and original.
