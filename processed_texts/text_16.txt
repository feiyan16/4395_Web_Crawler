this week that she tried to get an audition for director Chris Nolan’s 2012 “The Dark Knight Rises.”

Kravitz emphasized later Tuesday on Instagram that “The Dark Knight Rises” role she sought wasn’t for Catwoman — it was for “a small part” she didn’t specify.
“It was like, ‘What does that have to do with anything?’ I have to play the role like, ‘Yo, what’s up, Batman?

“They told me that I couldn’t get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren’t ‘going urban,’” she told the outlet.
“I don’t know if it came directly from Chris Nolan,” she said.
“I think it was probably a casting director of some kind, or a casting director’s assistant.
“The Dark Knight Rises” starred Christian Bale as the caped crusader and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, the feline-like villain.
