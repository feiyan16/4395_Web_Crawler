It’s been done well, a number of times.”
When Reeves met with Keoghan about playing the Joker, he says he told the actor about his concerns.
“I thought it’d be really neat if so much of the fabric of Gotham just already existed,” Reeves tells
.
So Reeves and Marino turned to the original inspiration for the Joker: Conrad Veidt’s performance in the 1928 silent film “The Man Who Laughs,” based on a novel by Victor Hugo.
It was a scene to unsettle him.”
Ultimately, however, Reeves felt that the scene hit the same beat accomplished elsewhere in the movie.
It also isn’t impossible, that there is some story that comes back where Joker comes into our world.”
By the same token, Reeves is acutely aware of the
memorable performances actors have given as the Joker, including by Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto, and — earning them both Oscars — Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix.
I don’t know.’ And I still feel that way now.
While Dano’s Riddler especially takes center stage in driving the story, Reeves also wanted to give audiences the feeling that other possible Batman villains could be lurking in the periphery, just out of the camera’s gaze.
“So he knew that was the canvas he had to deal with.”
With
many Jokers in cinema history, the trick was figuring out how to differentiate Keoghan’s look as the character from his predecessors.
“You kind of felt like, well,
It changed the emotional stakes.
And he’s not yet the Joker — what’s this going to be?’ And then it seems so delicious in the story, since we’d already set him up, to have the end of the story, the completion of the Riddler arc, be that he was in a cell next to this guy.”
But when Reeves cut the first scene, he thought the second scene with the Riddler would need to go as well — cutting Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
“I initially tested it without it; when I put it back in, the scores for the ending went back up,” he says.
“It’s not an Easter egg scene,” he says.
So he cut it.
When he tested the movie, however, he realized that losing the Joker and Riddler’s
(to tweak a common phrase) affected the final scene of the film — in which Selina implores Batman to leave Gotham with her, knowing he’s fated to stay and fight for his city.
“I didn’t want to call him the Joker,” Reeves says.
As he wails in anguish, a voice from the cell next to his whispers from the door.
“I thought he would be really insecure about this and he’d probably want to find some way to get into the [Riddler’s] mindset, like in ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Mindhunter’ — this idea of profiling somebody, so you can predict his next move,” says Reeves.
“It’s something to think about with the Joker.
I think they’re doing the Joker.
Here’s everything the filmmaker had to say about the character and what his future could be within his “Batman” universe, including a possible HBO Max series about Arkham Asylum.
“There’s stuff I’m very interested in doing in an Arkham space, potentially for HBO Max.
Alas, between leaks from test screenings and
the internet thought plenty hard about who Keoghan was playing well before “The Batman” debuted, and sleuthed out that he was, indeed, playing the Joker.
That, along with the fact that I loved him as an actor, was the deciding factor.
Joker’s reply, as relayed by Reeves: “What do you mean, you want to know how he thinks?
“And [Batman] is resisting this idea violently.
So he put the Joker-Riddler scene back in.
“You realize that they have a relationship, and that this guy obviously did something, and Batman somehow got him into Arkham.”
As they talk, Batman tells Joker he wants to know how Riddler thinks.
Whether Keoghan will
playing the Joker remains an open question.
“What if this guy from birth had this disease and he was cursed?
You guys think the same.”
Reeves smiles.
“It’s not one of those end credits Marvel or DC scenes where it’s going, like, ‘Hey, here’s the next movie!’ In fact, I have no idea when or if we would return to that character in the movies.”
It turns out that Reeves’ had initially planned for Keoghan’s Joker to take a (slightly) bigger role in his film — only to almost cut Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
'” he says.
And so that’s what that scene was.
“You’re right,” Reeves says.
It changed people’s response to the very ending of the movie, to see that Gotham was still Gotham, and that Batman really didn’t have a choice.
The next, you’re a clown.” As the camera pulls back, Riddler and the inmate dissolve into laughter and a new, wicked friendship is born.
“It wasn’t necessary,” he says.
So Reeves shot a scene in which Batman snuck inside Arkham, arriving at the door of a specific inmate.
He has to keep doing what he’s gonna do.”
Reeves knows that introducing the Joker so close to the end of the movie will invariably lead audiences to expect to see more of him in the next film.
“And this guy says, ‘It’s almost our anniversary, isn’t it?
And then Joaquin comes in.
The character, played by
(“Eternals,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”), is credited as “Unseen Arkham Inmate.” But any astute Batman fan — or, for that matter, Batman neophyte — will know who this inmate is meant to be.
Next movie!
Even as a child, people looked at him with horror, and his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.”
When Keoghan’s casting was announced, his character was presented as a Gotham City cop named Stanley Merkel who works with Jim Gordon.
“What he’s really doing is getting into Batman’s head,” he says.
It didn’t feel the same.” Reeves also didn’t like losing the final beat of the Riddler’s arc, in which, after a lifetime of neglect and isolation, he finally finds a compatriot — albeit a murderous psychopath.
So I can imagine an actor going like, ‘There’s nowhere to go but down!
A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast

They already thought you can’t do the Joker again after Heath Ledger.
His face is half-covered through most of the film.” While it’s barely perceptible in the movie, Marino’s makeup evoked Veidt’s, giving Keoghan an unceasing rictus grin.
Between the Riddler’s notes casting an uncomfortable spotlight on Batman and the discovery that the Riddler is killing city leaders neck-deep in corruption, Batman finds himself unnerved over what to make of what the Riddler is doing.
“And I think it wasn’t just that people enjoyed seeing that character.
But that was not anywhere close to his goal.
And it’s already delicious.
He had this smile that people stared at that was grotesque and terrifying.
But he still worked with prosthetic makeup artist Michael Marino (“Coming 2 America”) to develop this Joker’s full look.
“Joaquin, as we were making the movie, had just won the Oscar.
'”
To keep an air of mystery, and reinforce the idea that this Joker hasn’t fully
the Joker, Reeves decided to shoot both of Keoghan’s scenes with the actor’s face obscured and partially out of focus.
“Because when Selena is saying to him, ‘This place is never going to change,’ you hadn’t seen that, in fact, trouble was already brewing,” Reeves says.
“One day you’re on top.
“He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific.
“It’s not about some version where he falls into a vat of chemicals and his face is distorted, or what [Christopher] Nolan did, where there’s some mystery to how he got these scars carved into his face,” he says.
“I never was trying to say like, ‘Hey, guess what, here’s the Joker.
In an early cut of “The Batman,” Keoghan actually showed up much earlier, in a scene following the revelation that the Riddler has killed the Gotham City police commissioner (before Jeffrey Wright’s Jim Gordon gets the job) and left behind yet another note addressed to the Batman.

When director
sat down to conceive
he wanted to embrace the idea from the comics that as Bruce Wayne (
) found his footing as a costumed vigilante, he would inspire his eventual rogues gallery to take on their equally larger-than-life personas.
So it’s very possible.
“It was one of those scenes where, given how complex the narrative was, by taking it out, it kept the story moving in a way it needed to.”
Cutting the first Joker scene was so heartbreaking that Reeves intends to release it once enough people have seen “The Batman.”
“It’s a really creepy, cool scene,” he says.
“There might be places,” Reeves says.
Even for a character who has just minutes of screen time, Reeves wanted to ensure that his film’s Joker was imbued with a clear psychological motivation, so he also extrapolated what it would be like for a kid to be born with a condition in which he never stopped smiling.
“The idea was more to say, ‘Hey, look, if you think that trouble is going to go away in Gotham, you can forget it.
“That was the scene that was meant to introduce this guy and just to tease the audience to go like, ‘Oh my god,
here too?
“I didn’t want to create all this speculation that we were doing the Joker by naming what he was, so we thought, well, let’s make him be a cop, and then people won’t really think too hard about it,” he says.
“I said to Barry, right from the beginning, ‘Look, I don’t know where this is going to go.
It’s already here.
“Barry was full in.
I can’t promise that it’ll even ever come back.
“And it was like an old Warner Bros. gangster movie and if you took a certain turn, you might see a character in his origins.”
That feeling is no better demonstrated than in the penultimate scene of the movie, after Dano’s Riddler has been locked up in Arkham Asylum, struck by despair that his grand plan to destroy Gotham has been foiled by Batman.
'” says Reeves.
“What is it they say?” the inmate says.
'” But Reeves also knew that if he announced Keoghan’s actual screen credit — “Unseen Arkham Inmate” — it wouldn’t take very long for fans to guess what he was up to.
“I said, ‘The shape of his hair, the shape of his mouth, it’s all going to read, but it’s going to be soft,'” Reeves says of his conversation with Marino.
'”
Reeves chuckles.
And we did it.”
Whether they’ll ever do it again will have to remain a tantalizing riddle for now.
There are things we’ve talked about there.
“I was looking not only for somebody who was a good actor, but somebody who was fearless,” he says.
I’m not sure exactly.”
For that reason, Reeves wanted someone eager to take on the “high-wire act” of playing the Joker, even if the performance only ever ended up lasting a few scant minutes.
Over the course of the film, that transformation commences for both villains — Paul Dano’s Riddler and Colin Farrell’s Penguin — as well as Batman’s quasi-partner in crimefighting, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), as she becomes Catwoman.
“We made a really concerted effort to make this different from the other ‘Batman’ movies, because we needed to,” he says.
“It is the Joker.”
While it may seem obvious that Reeves placed this scene at the end of “The Batman” to set up Keoghan as the lead villain for the inevitable sequel, the director was quick to explain that not only was that
his intention, he is in no way convinced that Keoghan’s Joker will appear in any more “Batman” movies.
“I wanted him to be this kind of lean forward thing for people who were fans to go like, ‘Oh my god, I think that’s the Joker.
“It’s like ‘Phantom of the Opera,'” Reeves says.

) found his footing as a costumed vigilante, he would inspire his eventual rogues gallery to take on their equally larger-than-life personas.
“I said to Barry, right from the beginning, ‘Look, I don’t know where this is going to go.
“It’s not one of those end credits Marvel or DC scenes where it’s going, like, ‘Hey, here’s the next movie!’ In fact, I have no idea when or if we would return to that character in the movies.”
It turns out that Reeves’ had initially planned for Keoghan’s Joker to take a (slightly) bigger role in his film — only to almost cut Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
So Reeves shot a scene in which Batman snuck inside Arkham, arriving at the door of a specific inmate.
'” But Reeves also knew that if he announced Keoghan’s actual screen credit — “Unseen Arkham Inmate” — it wouldn’t take very long for fans to guess what he was up to.
But that was not anywhere close to his goal.
There are things we’ve talked about there.
“And this guy says, ‘It’s almost our anniversary, isn’t it?
“I wanted him to be this kind of lean forward thing for people who were fans to go like, ‘Oh my god, I think that’s the Joker.
So he cut it.
“What if this guy from birth had this disease and he was cursed?
“He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific.
“I said, ‘The shape of his hair, the shape of his mouth, it’s all going to read, but it’s going to be soft,'” Reeves says of his conversation with Marino.
Here’s everything the filmmaker had to say about the character and what his future could be within his “Batman” universe, including a possible HBO Max series about Arkham Asylum.
Between the Riddler’s notes casting an uncomfortable spotlight on Batman and the discovery that the Riddler is killing city leaders neck-deep in corruption, Batman finds himself unnerved over what to make of what the Riddler is doing.
'”
Reeves chuckles.
“And it was like an old Warner Bros. gangster movie and if you took a certain turn, you might see a character in his origins.”
That feeling is no better demonstrated than in the penultimate scene of the movie, after Dano’s Riddler has been locked up in Arkham Asylum, struck by despair that his grand plan to destroy Gotham has been foiled by Batman.
I’m not sure exactly.”
For that reason, Reeves wanted someone eager to take on the “high-wire act” of playing the Joker, even if the performance only ever ended up lasting a few scant minutes.
While Dano’s Riddler especially takes center stage in driving the story, Reeves also wanted to give audiences the feeling that other possible Batman villains could be lurking in the periphery, just out of the camera’s gaze.
It changed people’s response to the very ending of the movie, to see that Gotham was still Gotham, and that Batman really didn’t have a choice.
I think they’re doing the Joker.
As he wails in anguish, a voice from the cell next to his whispers from the door.
So I can imagine an actor going like, ‘There’s nowhere to go but down!
Whether Keoghan will
playing the Joker remains an open question.
The next, you’re a clown.” As the camera pulls back, Riddler and the inmate dissolve into laughter and a new, wicked friendship is born.
“It is the Joker.”
While it may seem obvious that Reeves placed this scene at the end of “The Batman” to set up Keoghan as the lead villain for the inevitable sequel, the director was quick to explain that not only was that
his intention, he is in no way convinced that Keoghan’s Joker will appear in any more “Batman” movies.
So it’s very possible.
“He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific.
“I never was trying to say like, ‘Hey, guess what, here’s the Joker.
“You kind of felt like, well,
It changed the emotional stakes.
“I thought he would be really insecure about this and he’d probably want to find some way to get into the [Riddler’s] mindset, like in ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Mindhunter’ — this idea of profiling somebody, so you can predict his next move,” says Reeves.
He has to keep doing what he’s gonna do.”
Reeves knows that introducing the Joker so close to the end of the movie will invariably lead audiences to expect to see more of him in the next film.
That, along with the fact that I loved him as an actor, was the deciding factor.
Whether Keoghan will
playing the Joker remains an open question.
There are things we’ve talked about there.
“What is it they say?” the inmate says.
“Barry was full in.
“I didn’t want to create all this speculation that we were doing the Joker by naming what he was, so we thought, well, let’s make him be a cop, and then people won’t really think too hard about it,” he says.
So he cut it.
“I initially tested it without it; when I put it back in, the scores for the ending went back up,” he says.
You guys think the same.”
Reeves smiles.
When he tested the movie, however, he realized that losing the Joker and Riddler’s
(to tweak a common phrase) affected the final scene of the film — in which Selina implores Batman to leave Gotham with her, knowing he’s fated to stay and fight for his city.
And he’s not yet the Joker — what’s this going to be?’ And then it seems so delicious in the story, since we’d already set him up, to have the end of the story, the completion of the Riddler arc, be that he was in a cell next to this guy.”
But when Reeves cut the first scene, he thought the second scene with the Riddler would need to go as well — cutting Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
But he still worked with prosthetic makeup artist Michael Marino (“Coming 2 America”) to develop this Joker’s full look.
“There’s stuff I’m very interested in doing in an Arkham space, potentially for HBO Max.
So he put the Joker-Riddler scene back in.
It also isn’t impossible, that there is some story that comes back where Joker comes into our world.”
By the same token, Reeves is acutely aware of the
memorable performances actors have given as the Joker, including by Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto, and — earning them both Oscars — Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix.
“You realize that they have a relationship, and that this guy obviously did something, and Batman somehow got him into Arkham.”
As they talk, Batman tells Joker he wants to know how Riddler thinks.
It’s been done well, a number of times.”
When Reeves met with Keoghan about playing the Joker, he says he told the actor about his concerns.
As he wails in anguish, a voice from the cell next to his whispers from the door.
And then Joaquin comes in.
Over the course of the film, that transformation commences for both villains — Paul Dano’s Riddler and Colin Farrell’s Penguin — as well as Batman’s quasi-partner in crimefighting, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), as she becomes Catwoman.
“What he’s really doing is getting into Batman’s head,” he says.
“And [Batman] is resisting this idea violently.
They already thought you can’t do the Joker again after Heath Ledger.
'”
Reeves chuckles.
“I said to Barry, right from the beginning, ‘Look, I don’t know where this is going to go.
“It’s not about some version where he falls into a vat of chemicals and his face is distorted, or what [Christopher] Nolan did, where there’s some mystery to how he got these scars carved into his face,” he says.
'”
To keep an air of mystery, and reinforce the idea that this Joker hasn’t fully
the Joker, Reeves decided to shoot both of Keoghan’s scenes with the actor’s face obscured and partially out of focus.
“I didn’t want to call him the Joker,” Reeves says.
“So he knew that was the canvas he had to deal with.”
With
many Jokers in cinema history, the trick was figuring out how to differentiate Keoghan’s look as the character from his predecessors.
And we did it.”
Whether they’ll ever do it again will have to remain a tantalizing riddle for now.
'” But Reeves also knew that if he announced Keoghan’s actual screen credit — “Unseen Arkham Inmate” — it wouldn’t take very long for fans to guess what he was up to.
It didn’t feel the same.” Reeves also didn’t like losing the final beat of the Riddler’s arc, in which, after a lifetime of neglect and isolation, he finally finds a compatriot — albeit a murderous psychopath.
“I was looking not only for somebody who was a good actor, but somebody who was fearless,” he says.
“I wanted him to be this kind of lean forward thing for people who were fans to go like, ‘Oh my god, I think that’s the Joker.
I can’t promise that it’ll even ever come back.
It was a scene to unsettle him.”
Ultimately, however, Reeves felt that the scene hit the same beat accomplished elsewhere in the movie.
So Reeves and Marino turned to the original inspiration for the Joker: Conrad Veidt’s performance in the 1928 silent film “The Man Who Laughs,” based on a novel by Victor Hugo.
Next movie!
“And I think it wasn’t just that people enjoyed seeing that character.
So I can imagine an actor going like, ‘There’s nowhere to go but down!
“It’s something to think about with the Joker.
He had this smile that people stared at that was grotesque and terrifying.
“What if this guy from birth had this disease and he was cursed?
'” says Reeves.
“I thought it’d be really neat if so much of the fabric of Gotham just already existed,” Reeves tells
.
Even as a child, people looked at him with horror, and his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.”
When Keoghan’s casting was announced, his character was presented as a Gotham City cop named Stanley Merkel who works with Jim Gordon.
And it’s already delicious.
The character, played by
(“Eternals,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”), is credited as “Unseen Arkham Inmate.” But any astute Batman fan — or, for that matter, Batman neophyte — will know who this inmate is meant to be.
“Because when Selena is saying to him, ‘This place is never going to change,’ you hadn’t seen that, in fact, trouble was already brewing,” Reeves says.
“It’s not one of those end credits Marvel or DC scenes where it’s going, like, ‘Hey, here’s the next movie!’ In fact, I have no idea when or if we would return to that character in the movies.”
It turns out that Reeves’ had initially planned for Keoghan’s Joker to take a (slightly) bigger role in his film — only to almost cut Keoghan out of the movie entirely.

I don’t know.’ And I still feel that way now.
I’m not sure exactly.”
For that reason, Reeves wanted someone eager to take on the “high-wire act” of playing the Joker, even if the performance only ever ended up lasting a few scant minutes.
Joker’s reply, as relayed by Reeves: “What do you mean, you want to know how he thinks?
So Reeves shot a scene in which Batman snuck inside Arkham, arriving at the door of a specific inmate.
It changed people’s response to the very ending of the movie, to see that Gotham was still Gotham, and that Batman really didn’t have a choice.
“It’s like ‘Phantom of the Opera,'” Reeves says.
In an early cut of “The Batman,” Keoghan actually showed up much earlier, in a scene following the revelation that the Riddler has killed the Gotham City police commissioner (before Jeffrey Wright’s Jim Gordon gets the job) and left behind yet another note addressed to the Batman.
And so that’s what that scene was.
“It’s not an Easter egg scene,” he says.
“There might be places,” Reeves says.
“We made a really concerted effort to make this different from the other ‘Batman’ movies, because we needed to,” he says.
His face is half-covered through most of the film.” While it’s barely perceptible in the movie, Marino’s makeup evoked Veidt’s, giving Keoghan an unceasing rictus grin.
Alas, between leaks from test screenings and
the internet thought plenty hard about who Keoghan was playing well before “The Batman” debuted, and sleuthed out that he was, indeed, playing the Joker.
While Dano’s Riddler especially takes center stage in driving the story, Reeves also wanted to give audiences the feeling that other possible Batman villains could be lurking in the periphery, just out of the camera’s gaze.
“The idea was more to say, ‘Hey, look, if you think that trouble is going to go away in Gotham, you can forget it.
“That was the scene that was meant to introduce this guy and just to tease the audience to go like, ‘Oh my god,
here too?

I think they’re doing the Joker.
“And this guy says, ‘It’s almost our anniversary, isn’t it?
“It was one of those scenes where, given how complex the narrative was, by taking it out, it kept the story moving in a way it needed to.”
Cutting the first Joker scene was so heartbreaking that Reeves intends to release it once enough people have seen “The Batman.”
“It’s a really creepy, cool scene,” he says.
But that was not anywhere close to his goal.
“It wasn’t necessary,” he says.
“I said, ‘The shape of his hair, the shape of his mouth, it’s all going to read, but it’s going to be soft,'” Reeves says of his conversation with Marino.
“One day you’re on top.
Here’s everything the filmmaker had to say about the character and what his future could be within his “Batman” universe, including a possible HBO Max series about Arkham Asylum.
“You’re right,” Reeves says.
“Joaquin, as we were making the movie, had just won the Oscar.
Even for a character who has just minutes of screen time, Reeves wanted to ensure that his film’s Joker was imbued with a clear psychological motivation, so he also extrapolated what it would be like for a kid to be born with a condition in which he never stopped smiling.
'” he says.
