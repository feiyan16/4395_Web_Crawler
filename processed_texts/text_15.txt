That feat is not surprising because March has been relatively light in terms of new releases.
Three new movies opened nationwide, but the manga adaptation “
: The Movie,” A24’s slasher thriller “X,” and the Focus Features mystery drama “The Outfit” did not pose a threat to “The Batman.”

Meanwhile, “X” landed in fourth place with $4.2 million from 2,865 venues.
Directed by Graham Moore and starring Mark Rylance and Zoey Deutch, “The Outfit” has gotten positive reviews and holds a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.

But once the reclusive hosts, an elderly couple, catch the guests in the act, things get messy.
The Sony Pictures action-adventure scored $8 million from 3,700 theaters, taking “Uncharted” to $125.8 million at the domestic box office.
Tom Holland’s video game adaptation “Uncharted,” now in its fifth weekend of release, pulled ahead of “X” on box office charts to secure third place.

‘X’ should recover its costs and make a few dollars after all ancillary money is counted.”
Ti West wrote and directed “X,” which follows actors making an adult film in rural Texas.
Last spring, the film company opened “Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train” to $21.2 million,
at a time when cinemas were operating at reduced capacity.
Those numbers mark a quieter start, especially considering the loud praise “X” received after premiering at the South by Southwest film festival earlier this month.
Those ticket sales push “The Batman” past $300 million in North America, making the comic book adaptation the second pandemic-era movie to cross that benchmark after “Spider-Man: No Way Home.”
At the international box office, the Warner Bros. film opened in China — where 43% of the country’s theaters are closed due to COVID-19 cases — to a muted $12.1 million.
The movie collected $36.8 million from 4,302 theaters between Friday and Sunday, representing only a 45% decline from last weekend.

“The Outfit” debuted in eighth place, amassing a soft $1.5 million from 1,324 locations.
In total, “The Batman” added $49.1 million from 76 overseas markets, taking its global total to a mighty $598 million.
Channing Tatum’s canine adventure “Dog” took the No.
It’s a great result for the road-trip buddy comedy, which cost only $15 million to make.

Anyone who was hoping for a Tuesday bump is going to be disappointed.
Of course.
I think a lot of it depends on how it holds in April and how far it's gone by the time the 45 day window is over.
Uncharted - $935K (+13% || -14%)
No Way Home - $400K (+6 || -14%)
-0.2% from Wed!
That moves me from like 57 to 61.5ish
I’m going to go with $63m 2nd weekend.
I don't think it's going to pass dh2.
It opened here in Toronto on the Wednesday so the weekend gross is definitely a bit inflated.
Honestly these weekdays have been great.
$8.3m
Fantastic hold.
It's obviously possible but I think it's going to come in just under.
If it can push to 70 (highly unlikely) then it will definitely get to 400M, but with like a 62-65M, it will end around 375+
Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:
Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:
I would assume same calendar configuration = same dates for spring holidays.
-0.2% from Wed!
Let's see how Spring break affects things starting tomorrow, but I think a higher than expected Saturday jump and lower than expected Sunday drop and next weekdays behaving like Mid-May weekdays.
Dog $543,197 (-15% LW)
Second Weekend Range:
Second Weekend Range:
If you want a narrower one check out page 5
Do you guys think Dog can beat Gucci domestically?
I thought with the runtime it might struggle with weekdays and excel on weekends.
I'm gonna say it does it.
Better Sun drops though
Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:
That's just how Thursdays used to be when there were no big openers.
I think this weekend might surprise a lot of us.
It's beating it.
2.84 multiplier; certainly seems possible given WoM seems to be more on the positive side.
70m 2nd weekend is a possibility?
BvS Thursday to weekend multiple gets it to 56.7M, 62-65M seems like a possible weekend.
That moves me from like 57 to 61.5ish

The opening weekend gross of 134 includes all sneak previews doesn't it?
Fri and Sat jumps will be prolly affected too.
Do you guys think Dog can beat Gucci domestically?
Hoping for $18M on Friday.
Impending spring break would mean a likely increase for all holdovers.
2.84 would be a great multiplier.
$8.3m

I think weekday numbers will be hard on this one with the 3 hour run time and weekend numbers should hold up better.
Fri and Sat jumps will be prolly affected too.
70m 2nd weekend is a possibility?

Anyone who was hoping for a Tuesday bump is going to be disappointed.
If it can push to 70 (highly unlikely) then it will definitely get to 400M, but with like a 62-65M, it will end around 375+
Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:

I would assume same calendar configuration = same dates for spring holidays.
Let's see how Spring break affects things starting tomorrow, but I think a higher than expected Saturday jump and lower than expected Sunday drop and next weekdays behaving like Mid-May weekdays.
2.84 multiplier; certainly seems possible given WoM seems to be more on the positive side.
I thought with the runtime it might struggle with weekdays and excel on weekends.
I don't think it's going to pass dh2.

That moves me from like 57 to 61.5ish
How are the chances for the Bat to end up over

That's just how Thursdays used to be when there were no big openers.

It opened here in Toronto on the Wednesday so the weekend gross is definitely a bit inflated.
I think a lot of it depends on how it holds in April and how far it's gone by the time the 45 day window is over.
2.84 would be a great multiplier.

Fantastic hold.
