It was absurd.”
Reeves’ literal anonymity behind the camera makes what he’s achieved with “The Batman,” which opens in theaters on March 4, that much more remarkable.
“Because then if you want it to be me, you have to tell me you’re willing to do what I want to do.
“I think a lot of people try to bullshit themselves that they’re not afraid of anything.
“If it was a tense scene, you’d suddenly hear his breathing accelerate.
“I thought that I was going to make something in the vein of a Hal Ashby comedy,” he says.
“We were always directly connected, and it’s weird, because we were also physically distant,” Reeves says.
“I could talk to him very low.
Until this comes out, I doubt he’s thought about the next steps yet.
“But to be honest with you, I just don’t know how I would make my way through that.
“I just love how fucking observant he is,” he says.
I don’t mean that in some kind of arrogant [way].
I’m not saying that I’m happy about that.
I think that is the way forward in a world where you have to take a bet on a known horse.”
To be fair, the “Batman” movies have often drawn top-drawer talent — from Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer to Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Marion Cotillard — not to mention that Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix have both won Oscars for playing the Joker.
“No other actor’s ever said that to me, and, by the way, he’s exactly right.”
Reeves developed this filmmaking style while directing “Felicity” and contending with the relentless schedule pressures of TV production.
“The thing about being a kid is you feel so helpless.
“You only have so much time,” he says.
As first, you obviously think you’re doing something wrong.
“He had a specific vision,” says Emmerich.
Emmerich calls Batman “arguably the most valuable and important character within all of the Warner Bros. intellectual property,” and he understood that to make another movie with the character, “we needed an auteur, someone who was really going to create the DNA of this world.” Reeves’ initial ideas — starting with Batman’s second year as a crime fighter and focusing on his abilities as a detective — immediately won Emmerich over.
This is amazing.”
• • •
At once voluble and disarmingly candid, Reeves readily displays a looseness and affability during his February interview with
that belies an upbringing in Los Angeles that he calls “frightening” and “utter chaos.” Even his memories of watching the movie that sparked his interest in directing — “Raging Bull,” Martin Scorsese’s searing biopic of the brutish and domineering boxer Jake LaMotta — are fraught.
“I think he has a really good understanding of fear,” Pattinson says.
Perhaps to break the tension, Reeves remembers his father turning to him and asking what he thought of the movie.
It’s a strangely intimate experience.”
Reeves smiles when he learns this: “He never told me.
To allow Reeves and Pattinson to communicate on the set across the self-imposed COVID barriers between them, they were both outfitted with earpieces and microphones.
But Matt really acknowledges things that have scared him in his life and things that scare him presently, and can project those into his movies.”
In this iteration, Batman has been reinvented through Reeves’ lens to grapple with so many of today’s horrors — a profound disillusionment with institutions of power, how great wealth is a corrosive force, the specter of incel terrorists organizing via social media, even climate change — but at its center is a young man desperate to create order (yet again) inside the scarring tumult of his traumatic childhood.
“I said, very genuinely, ‘I thought that was the best-directed movie I’ve ever seen.’ I didn’t know what that meant.
Those Bruce Waynes, however, didn’t headline a film two years into a pandemic, with movie theaters on life support and the world rattled further by the gathering storm of war.
I’m just saying it is what it is.”
The mindset that he wasn’t suited for franchise filmmaking, ironically, became the secret to how Reeves got himself hired to direct “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” in 2012 — and later, “The Batman” in 2017.
Very specific angles, but a lot of takes.”
Informed of Pattinson’s observations, Reeves claps his hands in excitement.
That is a deeply personal story for Reeves, writ large into a nearly three-hour comic book movie about a billionaire scion who dresses like a bat to pummel criminals in the dead of night.
“I have to say, in another era, I don’t know, would all these same actors be drawn to do this movie?
“My dad was nothing like Jake LaMotta.
Reeves had spent lockdown working on the meticulous — and costly — safety protocols needed to complete the film, but just 24 hours after shooting restarted in London, he got the news that his star,
, had tested positive for COVID-19.
Sometimes, it would be very, very distracting, but sometimes I actually quite enjoyed hearing his real-time reaction.
He’s quick to add that he still has no idea whether he’ll next direct the Penguin series, or a second “Batman” movie, or both, let alone what that movie would be about, or who would appear in it.
The movie had already lost a crew member: Dialect coach Andrew Jack died at 76 in late March 2020, due to the coronavirus, which Reeves is convinced Jack contracted during the first weeks of production.
“The industry has changed so dramatically that if you’re going to make a movie that’s going to be in movie theaters, you’re not making anything that isn’t recognizable IP,” he says.
And I don’t think they would be happy with me either.”
At the same time, Reeves knew which way the winds were blowing.
“The performance is the thing that draws you through the experience.
I think in a certain way, the fact that movies have narrowed into a certain band makes each one a riskier bet.”
At the same time, superhero franchises have led many top filmmakers, like James Gunn (“Guardians of the Galaxy,” “The Suicide Squad”) and Ryan Coogler (“Black Panther”), to go all-in on comic book adaptations, developing TV projects that further expand the worlds of their movies.
But after Reeves’ follow-up film, “The Invisible Woman,” fell apart when star Naomi Watts dropped out, Abrams persuaded him to direct “Cloverfield,” the found-footage monster movie that became a surprise hit in 2008.
“I think part of what really drew me in is that the conflict in that movie …” He pauses.
But what’s so weird is I still feel that way today.”
The experience stayed with him as he graduated from tinkering with that 8mm camera into an early filmmaking career, imagining a future as a director of personal movies rooted in everyday life.
I think in the creative process, you can try to revisit your traumas.
To Reeves’ relief, Pattinson’s case was relatively mild, and his health recovered quickly.
I felt so out of control, in so many ways.” Playing director with his 8mm camera as a child, he says, “was the beginning of trying to get some agency, and I think that for a kid, the image of Batman is that idea.”
While Reeves may have loathed his physical isolation from his actors — he’s the kind of director who prefers sitting as close to the camera as possible — there was one unexpected benefit.
“The idea of humor through awkwardness.”
He attempted to find that balance early in his career, directing the 1996 indie romantic comedy “The Pallbearer” with David Schwimmer and Gwyneth Paltrow, and creating the beloved WB series “Felicity” in 1998 with his childhood friend J.J. Abrams.
Reeves is no exception: He’s working on two spinoff TV series for HBO Max, one about the Gotham City Police Department and the other about the rise to power of midlevel gangster Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot, aka the Penguin.
There has to be some level of discovery for me, where I have some freedom to find my way.
“All we did was shoot a day, and already it wasn’t just someone got COVID —
got COVID,” Reeves says.
“That’s just where the audience has gone.
I really hope that one day, I’m able to do them.”
The Business of Entertainment
In September 2020, the director had just returned to filming on “
,” Warner Bros.’ latest reboot of the studio’s multibillion-dollar superhero franchise, after a six-month break due to the pandemic.
Or maybe he has, and he hasn’t told me.”
Reeves could even follow in the footsteps of Nolan and shoot his own original movie in between superhero projects.
(He certainly needs it: In a terribly irony, Reeves contracted COVID at some point after his interview with
,
via video at the March 1 premiere of “The Batman” in New York City.)
He still holds a torch for “The Invisible Woman,” the family drama he was going to make before “Cloverfield.”
“I’ve been wanting to find my way back to that,” he says, almost wistfully.
Reeves just may have crafted the perfect superhero for our age of anxiety.
If I have to come into something that’s already set too firmly, then I think I would get lost.
“I have such respect for Kevin Feige and also for the [Marvel] filmmakers,” he says.
I want to be able to go on that search with the actors, so I would much rather get one angle and spend an hour on it than get five angles and spend whatever short time you could.”
On “The Batman,” that approach also translated to hand-to-hand combat, which Reeves deliberately wanted to differentiate from the kinetic, quick-cutting fight scenes shot by his predecessors, including Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan.
I mean, when you go, hey, it’s the only game in town, what’s really neat is we’re all pushing to be really ambitious.
“I always enter into it with the idea that it’s not going to be me,” Reeves says.
I’ve never been so close to a director’s perception of what I was doing before.
But he was everything like Jake LaMotta.”
It was one of the only times he can remember seeing a movie with both of his parents; at dinner afterward, they stewed in silence.
“There’s so many great ‘Batman’ movies, it would have been suicide, not just for me but also for the studio, if they thought they could just make another ‘Batman’ movie,” he says.
The latter series, which Lauren LeFranc (“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”) is writing, is much closer to shooting, but it arose after Reeves mentioned offhand to some studio executives that he thought a second “Batman” movie could focus on how Oz became a crime kingpin.

was terrified.
With a $200 million budget, the question is whether Reeves’ saturnine crime epic will follow in the blockbuster footsteps of “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” or face-plant like the “Batman” films starring George Clooney and (to a lesser extent) Ben Affleck.
But once you realize his rhythm, he’s editing the entire movie, every single take.
“So I think it’s going to be harder to make these movies.
Along with his work directing 2014’s “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” and 2017’s “War for the Planet of the Apes,” the 55-year-old has become the rare filmmaker who can step into extremely well-established franchises — eight actors, not including Pattinson, have played or voiced the Caped Crusader in feature films since the 1960s — and manage to mold them to his own sensibility.
And so: ‘Please, if you don’t like what I’m saying, do not hire me.’ And that so far has worked for me.”
• • •
So how did Reeves make a giant superhero movie work for him?
“I was like this ridiculous, hermetically sealed creature.
So Reeves transformed himself on set into “a burrito,” wearing a mask, a head covering and scuba diving goggles — “because Fauci had said something about covering your eyes.” In effect, Reeves’ appearance was not unlike Paul Dano’s totally obscuring uniform as the film’s foreboding villain, the Riddler.
“What’s exciting about doing a ‘Batman’ movie is the opportunity to do something on a scale that you really can’t do unless you’re doing that kind of movie, and still make it feel personal and distinctive,” he says.
“Because we had no vaccines or anything, I was like, if I go down, we’re not going to finish the movie,” the director says.
The long takes allowed Reeves to lay bare Bruce Wayne’s all-consuming desire for vengeance — think of that harrowing shot of Pattinson wailing on a kid from the first teaser for “The Batman” — and explicate why he felt so compelled to make yet another movie in the murk of Gotham City.
But with three-quarters of “The Batman” left to film, the experience had exposed, in rather spectacular fashion, just how precarious the production really was.
But that also means there was that much more of an imperative for Reeves to make his “Batman” justify its existence.
“You couldn’t see my face, and this is the way the actors saw me for the rest of the movie,” Reeves says.
“You could hear his little reactions,” Pattinson says.

Reeves started fielding inquiries about directing tentpoles — including superhero movies — that thrive on larger-than-life spectacle instead of the nuances of the human condition.
You’ll never change what happened, but you’ll change the meaning of them, and you’ll change your relationship to them.”
Absent the opportunity to do that kind of storytelling through original, human-scale films like his 1970s filmmaking idols, Reeves was eager to take advantage of the massive canvass — and studio-backed resources — superhero movies can provide.
“There are other projects I’d like to do.
“My mother was not one who liked the idea of seeing an R-rated film,” he says.
In both cases, when Reeves was invited to meet with studio executives to discuss the possibility of directing these films, he told them point-blank: “Look, I’m probably not the director you want, and that’s OK.”
“He did say that,” says Warner Bros. Pictures Group chair Toby Emmerich with a chuckle.
I was like 14 years old.
All that will be decided after he takes a much-needed break with his wife and 10-year-old son.
You’re not going to get a good movie from me if you don’t let me do what I do, because I don’t know how to do it another way.
I think we were in each other’s head.
Initially, Reeves resisted, unable to see how his creative interests could succeed inside comic book franchises like the interconnected Marvel Cinematic Universe.
“And they were like, ‘Oh, we want to do that as a show,’” Reeves says with a chuckle.
He doesn’t really do an enormous amount of coverage.
“Which he didn’t always do,” Reeves says.
“He’s very, very, very one-track-minded — well, one-project-minded, I guess.
“His vigilantism is like filmmaking for me,” Reeves says.
“He spent five years from conception to completion of this,” says Pattinson.
That had a particular effect.”
More than Reeves realized: According to Pattinson, there were times when, while cameras were rolling, Reeves’ mic was accidentally left on.
“He’s very methodical,” Pattinson says.
“Does a lot of takes.
“This idea of approaching action so that you can actually see what’s happening, and that you’re following it in a way that is utterly convincing,” he says.
“I related to his desperate attempt, I think, to try to find a way to reorder his life in the wake of something that was impossible to change,” Reeves says.
“That’s the way in which I relate to Bruce’s mission.
I don't think that is something you will see any time soon."
Variable pricing — charging more for tickets to movies with higher demand — has been
as a potential strategy to help boost the struggling exhibition business, but consistently faced widespread resistance in North America.
Last week during
, CFO Melissa Thomas said the theater chain was "in the midst of a series of tests to better understand how elasticities have evolved during the pandemic to further optimize our base pricing levels going forward," which "could mean increases or decreases in pricing, depending upon theater, market, time of day, week, and various other factors."
As of this writing, AMC is charging $1.50 more for an adult ticket to the superhero film in Los Angeles, compared to a ticket to another movie at the same time and same venue.
As with so much in the entertainment industry, however, the pandemic has

suggested that 8 percent of pre-pandemic moviegoers may never return to theaters, and
on American exhibitors to rethink the experience they provide.
"AMC has been a bold thinker in the area of pricing," he said.
As financial analyst Eric Handler
, "When you charge a lower price, right there you are saying the movie isn't as good as another film.
Most major theater chains already charge higher prices for evening and weekend showtimes at many locations; indeed, Aron, the AMC CEO, said the chain's
pricing was a natural extension of this strategy.
Variable pricing, it seems, will be part of this rethinking.
You are saying you have to discount it in order for people to show up.

AMC Theatres is charging higher prices for tickets to
, CEO Adam Aron announced Tuesday, as the movie theater chain begins to experiment with so-called variable pricing for different films.
You’re not going to get a good movie from me if you don’t let me do what I do, because I don’t know how to do it another way.
“My dad was nothing like Jake LaMotta.
As first, you obviously think you’re doing something wrong.
“I was like this ridiculous, hermetically sealed creature.
“And they were like, ‘Oh, we want to do that as a show,’” Reeves says with a chuckle.
In both cases, when Reeves was invited to meet with studio executives to discuss the possibility of directing these films, he told them point-blank: “Look, I’m probably not the director you want, and that’s OK.”
“He did say that,” says Warner Bros. Pictures Group chair Toby Emmerich with a chuckle.
“But to be honest with you, I just don’t know how I would make my way through that.
“The thing about being a kid is you feel so helpless.
I want to be able to go on that search with the actors, so I would much rather get one angle and spend an hour on it than get five angles and spend whatever short time you could.”
On “The Batman,” that approach also translated to hand-to-hand combat, which Reeves deliberately wanted to differentiate from the kinetic, quick-cutting fight scenes shot by his predecessors, including Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan.
“I said, very genuinely, ‘I thought that was the best-directed movie I’ve ever seen.’ I didn’t know what that meant.
“What’s exciting about doing a ‘Batman’ movie is the opportunity to do something on a scale that you really can’t do unless you’re doing that kind of movie, and still make it feel personal and distinctive,” he says.
But Matt really acknowledges things that have scared him in his life and things that scare him presently, and can project those into his movies.”
In this iteration, Batman has been reinvented through Reeves’ lens to grapple with so many of today’s horrors — a profound disillusionment with institutions of power, how great wealth is a corrosive force, the specter of incel terrorists organizing via social media, even climate change — but at its center is a young man desperate to create order (yet again) inside the scarring tumult of his traumatic childhood.
“No other actor’s ever said that to me, and, by the way, he’s exactly right.”
Reeves developed this filmmaking style while directing “Felicity” and contending with the relentless schedule pressures of TV production.
It’s a strangely intimate experience.”
Reeves smiles when he learns this: “He never told me.
I think we were in each other’s head.
Reeves had spent lockdown working on the meticulous — and costly — safety protocols needed to complete the film, but just 24 hours after shooting restarted in London, he got the news that his star,
, had tested positive for COVID-19.
“He’s very methodical,” Pattinson says.
“If it was a tense scene, you’d suddenly hear his breathing accelerate.
“Which he didn’t always do,” Reeves says.
I’ve never been so close to a director’s perception of what I was doing before.
But that also means there was that much more of an imperative for Reeves to make his “Batman” justify its existence.
And so: ‘Please, if you don’t like what I’m saying, do not hire me.’ And that so far has worked for me.”

So how did Reeves make a giant superhero movie work for him?
“The industry has changed so dramatically that if you’re going to make a movie that’s going to be in movie theaters, you’re not making anything that isn’t recognizable IP,” he says.
“I just love how fucking observant he is,” he says.
“I think a lot of people try to bullshit themselves that they’re not afraid of anything.
“The performance is the thing that draws you through the experience.
“He spent five years from conception to completion of this,” says Pattinson.
Reeves started fielding inquiries about directing tentpoles — including superhero movies — that thrive on larger-than-life spectacle instead of the nuances of the human condition.
Along with his work directing 2014’s “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” and 2017’s “War for the Planet of the Apes,” the 55-year-old has become the rare filmmaker who can step into extremely well-established franchises — eight actors, not including Pattinson, have played or voiced the Caped Crusader in feature films since the 1960s — and manage to mold them to his own sensibility.
“I always enter into it with the idea that it’s not going to be me,” Reeves says.
To Reeves’ relief, Pattinson’s case was relatively mild, and his health recovered quickly.
But after Reeves’ follow-up film, “The Invisible Woman,” fell apart when star Naomi Watts dropped out, Abrams persuaded him to direct “Cloverfield,” the found-footage monster movie that became a surprise hit in 2008.
And I don’t think they would be happy with me either.”
At the same time, Reeves knew which way the winds were blowing.
“So I think it’s going to be harder to make these movies.
“That’s just where the audience has gone.
“There are other projects I’d like to do.
“We were always directly connected, and it’s weird, because we were also physically distant,” Reeves says.
I think in the creative process, you can try to revisit your traumas.
“You could hear his little reactions,” Pattinson says.
The long takes allowed Reeves to lay bare Bruce Wayne’s all-consuming desire for vengeance — think of that harrowing shot of Pattinson wailing on a kid from the first teaser for “The Batman” — and explicate why he felt so compelled to make yet another movie in the murk of Gotham City.
“He had a specific vision,” says Emmerich.
There has to be some level of discovery for me, where I have some freedom to find my way.
“My mother was not one who liked the idea of seeing an R-rated film,” he says.
That had a particular effect.”
More than Reeves realized: According to Pattinson, there were times when, while cameras were rolling, Reeves’ mic was accidentally left on.
(He certainly needs it: In a terribly irony, Reeves contracted COVID at some point after his interview with
,
via video at the March 1 premiere of “The Batman” in New York City.)
“I think he has a really good understanding of fear,” Pattinson says.
Emmerich calls Batman “arguably the most valuable and important character within all of the Warner Bros. intellectual property,” and he understood that to make another movie with the character, “we needed an auteur, someone who was really going to create the DNA of this world.” Reeves’ initial ideas — starting with Batman’s second year as a crime fighter and focusing on his abilities as a detective — immediately won Emmerich over.
If I have to come into something that’s already set too firmly, then I think I would get lost.
Very specific angles, but a lot of takes.”
Informed of Pattinson’s observations, Reeves claps his hands in excitement.
I think that is the way forward in a world where you have to take a bet on a known horse.”
To be fair, the “Batman” movies have often drawn top-drawer talent — from Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer to Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Marion Cotillard — not to mention that Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix have both won Oscars for playing the Joker.
“I have such respect for Kevin Feige and also for the [Marvel] filmmakers,” he says.
It was absurd.”
Reeves’ literal anonymity behind the camera makes what he’s achieved with “The Batman,” which opens in theaters on March 4, that much more remarkable.
I’m not saying that I’m happy about that.
With a $200 million budget, the question is whether Reeves’ saturnine crime epic will follow in the blockbuster footsteps of “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” or face-plant like the “Batman” films starring George Clooney and (to a lesser extent) Ben Affleck.
Reeves just may have crafted the perfect superhero for our age of anxiety.
The movie had already lost a crew member: Dialect coach Andrew Jack died at 76 in late March 2020, due to the coronavirus, which Reeves is convinced Jack contracted during the first weeks of production.
I felt so out of control, in so many ways.” Playing director with his 8mm camera as a child, he says, “was the beginning of trying to get some agency, and I think that for a kid, the image of Batman is that idea.”
While Reeves may have loathed his physical isolation from his actors — he’s the kind of director who prefers sitting as close to the camera as possible — there was one unexpected benefit.
I’m just saying it is what it is.”
The mindset that he wasn’t suited for franchise filmmaking, ironically, became the secret to how Reeves got himself hired to direct “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” in 2012 — and later, “The Batman” in 2017.
I really hope that one day, I’m able to do them.”
The Business of Entertainment
All that will be decided after he takes a much-needed break with his wife and 10-year-old son.
In September 2020, the director had just returned to filming on “
,” Warner Bros.’ latest reboot of the studio’s multibillion-dollar superhero franchise, after a six-month break due to the pandemic.
“All we did was shoot a day, and already it wasn’t just someone got COVID —
got COVID,” Reeves says.
To allow Reeves and Pattinson to communicate on the set across the self-imposed COVID barriers between them, they were both outfitted with earpieces and microphones.
But what’s so weird is I still feel that way today.”
The experience stayed with him as he graduated from tinkering with that 8mm camera into an early filmmaking career, imagining a future as a director of personal movies rooted in everyday life.
“Because then if you want it to be me, you have to tell me you’re willing to do what I want to do.
Or maybe he has, and he hasn’t told me.”
Reeves could even follow in the footsteps of Nolan and shoot his own original movie in between superhero projects.
That is a deeply personal story for Reeves, writ large into a nearly three-hour comic book movie about a billionaire scion who dresses like a bat to pummel criminals in the dead of night.
“Does a lot of takes.
“You couldn’t see my face, and this is the way the actors saw me for the rest of the movie,” Reeves says.
I think in a certain way, the fact that movies have narrowed into a certain band makes each one a riskier bet.”
At the same time, superhero franchises have led many top filmmakers, like James Gunn (“Guardians of the Galaxy,” “The Suicide Squad”) and Ryan Coogler (“Black Panther”), to go all-in on comic book adaptations, developing TV projects that further expand the worlds of their movies.
He still holds a torch for “The Invisible Woman,” the family drama he was going to make before “Cloverfield.”
“I’ve been wanting to find my way back to that,” he says, almost wistfully.
“There’s so many great ‘Batman’ movies, it would have been suicide, not just for me but also for the studio, if they thought they could just make another ‘Batman’ movie,” he says.
So Reeves transformed himself on set into “a burrito,” wearing a mask, a head covering and scuba diving goggles — “because Fauci had said something about covering your eyes.” In effect, Reeves’ appearance was not unlike Paul Dano’s totally obscuring uniform as the film’s foreboding villain, the Riddler.
“He’s very, very, very one-track-minded — well, one-project-minded, I guess.
(The cast includes Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Colin Farrell as the Penguin, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon and Andy Serkis as Alfred.)
Initially, Reeves resisted, unable to see how his creative interests could succeed inside comic book franchises like the interconnected Marvel Cinematic Universe.
I don’t mean that in some kind of arrogant [way].
This is amazing.”

At once voluble and disarmingly candid, Reeves readily displays a looseness and affability during his February interview with
that belies an upbringing in Los Angeles that he calls “frightening” and “utter chaos.” Even his memories of watching the movie that sparked his interest in directing — “Raging Bull,” Martin Scorsese’s searing biopic of the brutish and domineering boxer Jake LaMotta — are fraught.
“I think part of what really drew me in is that the conflict in that movie …” He pauses.
But with three-quarters of “The Batman” left to film, the experience had exposed, in rather spectacular fashion, just how precarious the production really was.
I was like 14 years old.
Those Bruce Waynes, however, didn’t headline a film two years into a pandemic, with movie theaters on life support and the world rattled further by the gathering storm of war.
You’ll never change what happened, but you’ll change the meaning of them, and you’ll change your relationship to them.”
Absent the opportunity to do that kind of storytelling through original, human-scale films like his 1970s filmmaking idols, Reeves was eager to take advantage of the massive canvass — and studio-backed resources — superhero movies can provide.
“Because we had no vaccines or anything, I was like, if I go down, we’re not going to finish the movie,” the director says.
But he was everything like Jake LaMotta.”
It was one of the only times he can remember seeing a movie with both of his parents; at dinner afterward, they stewed in silence.
“I have to say, in another era, I don’t know, would all these same actors be drawn to do this movie?
“His vigilantism is like filmmaking for me,” Reeves says.
Perhaps to break the tension, Reeves remembers his father turning to him and asking what he thought of the movie.
Sometimes, it would be very, very distracting, but sometimes I actually quite enjoyed hearing his real-time reaction.
He doesn’t really do an enormous amount of coverage.
The latter series, which Lauren LeFranc (“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”) is writing, is much closer to shooting, but it arose after Reeves mentioned offhand to some studio executives that he thought a second “Batman” movie could focus on how Oz became a crime kingpin.
Reeves is no exception: He’s working on two spinoff TV series for HBO Max, one about the Gotham City Police Department and the other about the rise to power of midlevel gangster Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot, aka the Penguin.
“The idea of humor through awkwardness.”
He attempted to find that balance early in his career, directing the 1996 indie romantic comedy “The Pallbearer” with David Schwimmer and Gwyneth Paltrow, and creating the beloved WB series “Felicity” in 1998 with his childhood friend J.J. Abrams.

I mean, when you go, hey, it’s the only game in town, what’s really neat is we’re all pushing to be really ambitious.
“You only have so much time,” he says.
“This idea of approaching action so that you can actually see what’s happening, and that you’re following it in a way that is utterly convincing,” he says.
Until this comes out, I doubt he’s thought about the next steps yet.
But once you realize his rhythm, he’s editing the entire movie, every single take.
“That’s the way in which I relate to Bruce’s mission.
“I thought that I was going to make something in the vein of a Hal Ashby comedy,” he says.
He’s quick to add that he still has no idea whether he’ll next direct the Penguin series, or a second “Batman” movie, or both, let alone what that movie would be about, or who would appear in it.
“I related to his desperate attempt, I think, to try to find a way to reorder his life in the wake of something that was impossible to change,” Reeves says.
“I could talk to him very low.
