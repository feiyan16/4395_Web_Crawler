‘The Batman’ Ending: Matt Reeves on Barry Keoghan’s Role – Variety

Senior Entertainment Writer
When director
sat down to conceive
he wanted to embrace the idea from the comics that as Bruce Wayne (
) found his footing as a costumed vigilante, he would inspire his eventual rogues gallery to take on their equally larger-than-life personas.
“I was looking not only for somebody who was a good actor, but somebody who was fearless,” he says.
That, along with the fact that I loved him as an actor, was the deciding factor.
It also isn’t impossible, that there is some story that comes back where Joker comes into our world.”
By the same token, Reeves is acutely aware of the
memorable performances actors have given as the Joker, including by Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto, and — earning them both Oscars — Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix.
I’m not sure exactly.”
For that reason, Reeves wanted someone eager to take on the “high-wire act” of playing the Joker, even if the performance only ever ended up lasting a few scant minutes.
Alas, between leaks from test screenings and
the internet thought plenty hard about who Keoghan was playing well before “The Batman” debuted, and sleuthed out that he was, indeed, playing the Joker.
'” says Reeves.
In an early cut of “The Batman,” Keoghan actually showed up much earlier, in a scene following the revelation that the Riddler has killed the Gotham City police commissioner (before Jeffrey Wright’s Jim Gordon gets the job) and left behind yet another note addressed to the Batman.
“You’re right,” Reeves says.
“I initially tested it without it; when I put it back in, the scores for the ending went back up,” he says.
Even as a child, people looked at him with horror, and his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.”
When Keoghan’s casting was announced, his character was presented as a Gotham City cop named Stanley Merkel who works with Jim Gordon.
The next, you’re a clown.” As the camera pulls back, Riddler and the inmate dissolve into laughter and a new, wicked friendship is born.
“It’s not an Easter egg scene,” he says.
“It wasn’t necessary,” he says.
“I didn’t want to create all this speculation that we were doing the Joker by naming what he was, so we thought, well, let’s make him be a cop, and then people won’t really think too hard about it,” he says.
And so that’s what that scene was.
He had this smile that people stared at that was grotesque and terrifying.
So he put the Joker-Riddler scene back in.
Next movie!
“And [Batman] is resisting this idea violently.
“I thought it’d be really neat if so much of the fabric of Gotham just already existed,” Reeves tells
.
And he’s not yet the Joker — what’s this going to be?’ And then it seems so delicious in the story, since we’d already set him up, to have the end of the story, the completion of the Riddler arc, be that he was in a cell next to this guy.”
But when Reeves cut the first scene, he thought the second scene with the Riddler would need to go as well — cutting Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
So I can imagine an actor going like, ‘There’s nowhere to go but down!
It’s been done well, a number of times.”
When Reeves met with Keoghan about playing the Joker, he says he told the actor about his concerns.
It was a scene to unsettle him.”
Ultimately, however, Reeves felt that the scene hit the same beat accomplished elsewhere in the movie.
Joker’s reply, as relayed by Reeves: “What do you mean, you want to know how he thinks?
Whether Keoghan will
playing the Joker remains an open question.
“Barry was full in.
I don’t know.’ And I still feel that way now.
Between the Riddler’s notes casting an uncomfortable spotlight on Batman and the discovery that the Riddler is killing city leaders neck-deep in corruption, Batman finds himself unnerved over what to make of what the Riddler is doing.
But he still worked with prosthetic makeup artist Michael Marino (“Coming 2 America”) to develop this Joker’s full look.
“One day you’re on top.
A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast
The Business of Entertainment
“It was one of those scenes where, given how complex the narrative was, by taking it out, it kept the story moving in a way it needed to.”
Cutting the first Joker scene was so heartbreaking that Reeves intends to release it once enough people have seen “The Batman.”
“It’s a really creepy, cool scene,” he says.
'”
Reeves chuckles.
“What he’s really doing is getting into Batman’s head,” he says.
While Dano’s Riddler especially takes center stage in driving the story, Reeves also wanted to give audiences the feeling that other possible Batman villains could be lurking in the periphery, just out of the camera’s gaze.
“I thought he would be really insecure about this and he’d probably want to find some way to get into the [Riddler’s] mindset, like in ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Mindhunter’ — this idea of profiling somebody, so you can predict his next move,” says Reeves.
It’s already here.
Here’s everything the filmmaker had to say about the character and what his future could be within his “Batman” universe, including a possible HBO Max series about Arkham Asylum.
There are things we’ve talked about there.
“I didn’t want to call him the Joker,” Reeves says.
“Because when Selena is saying to him, ‘This place is never going to change,’ you hadn’t seen that, in fact, trouble was already brewing,” Reeves says.
But that was not anywhere close to his goal.
And then Joaquin comes in.
He has to keep doing what he’s gonna do.”
Reeves knows that introducing the Joker so close to the end of the movie will invariably lead audiences to expect to see more of him in the next film.
“There’s stuff I’m very interested in doing in an Arkham space, potentially for HBO Max.
I can’t promise that it’ll even ever come back.
His face is half-covered through most of the film.” While it’s barely perceptible in the movie, Marino’s makeup evoked Veidt’s, giving Keoghan an unceasing rictus grin.
“And I think it wasn’t just that people enjoyed seeing that character.
So Reeves and Marino turned to the original inspiration for the Joker: Conrad Veidt’s performance in the 1928 silent film “The Man Who Laughs,” based on a novel by Victor Hugo.
“And it was like an old Warner Bros. gangster movie and if you took a certain turn, you might see a character in his origins.”
That feeling is no better demonstrated than in the penultimate scene of the movie, after Dano’s Riddler has been locked up in Arkham Asylum, struck by despair that his grand plan to destroy Gotham has been foiled by Batman.
“So he knew that was the canvas he had to deal with.”
With
many Jokers in cinema history, the trick was figuring out how to differentiate Keoghan’s look as the character from his predecessors.
“What is it they say?” the inmate says.
“You realize that they have a relationship, and that this guy obviously did something, and Batman somehow got him into Arkham.”
As they talk, Batman tells Joker he wants to know how Riddler thinks.
“It is the Joker.”
While it may seem obvious that Reeves placed this scene at the end of “The Batman” to set up Keoghan as the lead villain for the inevitable sequel, the director was quick to explain that not only was that
his intention, he is in no way convinced that Keoghan’s Joker will appear in any more “Batman” movies.
“The idea was more to say, ‘Hey, look, if you think that trouble is going to go away in Gotham, you can forget it.
The character, played by
(“Eternals,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”), is credited as “Unseen Arkham Inmate.” But any astute Batman fan — or, for that matter, Batman neophyte — will know who this inmate is meant to be.
'”
To keep an air of mystery, and reinforce the idea that this Joker hasn’t fully
the Joker, Reeves decided to shoot both of Keoghan’s scenes with the actor’s face obscured and partially out of focus.
“What if this guy from birth had this disease and he was cursed?
“That was the scene that was meant to introduce this guy and just to tease the audience to go like, ‘Oh my god,
here too?
“You kind of felt like, well,
It changed the emotional stakes.
You guys think the same.”
Reeves smiles.
When he tested the movie, however, he realized that losing the Joker and Riddler’s
(to tweak a common phrase) affected the final scene of the film — in which Selina implores Batman to leave Gotham with her, knowing he’s fated to stay and fight for his city.
“He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific.
“I wanted him to be this kind of lean forward thing for people who were fans to go like, ‘Oh my god, I think that’s the Joker.
So it’s very possible.
As he wails in anguish, a voice from the cell next to his whispers from the door.
It didn’t feel the same.” Reeves also didn’t like losing the final beat of the Riddler’s arc, in which, after a lifetime of neglect and isolation, he finally finds a compatriot — albeit a murderous psychopath.
Even for a character who has just minutes of screen time, Reeves wanted to ensure that his film’s Joker was imbued with a clear psychological motivation, so he also extrapolated what it would be like for a kid to be born with a condition in which he never stopped smiling.
And we did it.”
Whether they’ll ever do it again will have to remain a tantalizing riddle for now.
“I said, ‘The shape of his hair, the shape of his mouth, it’s all going to read, but it’s going to be soft,'” Reeves says of his conversation with Marino.
“And this guy says, ‘It’s almost our anniversary, isn’t it?
Over the course of the film, that transformation commences for both villains — Paul Dano’s Riddler and Colin Farrell’s Penguin — as well as Batman’s quasi-partner in crimefighting, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), as she becomes Catwoman.
“It’s like ‘Phantom of the Opera,'” Reeves says.
I think they’re doing the Joker.
“It’s not one of those end credits Marvel or DC scenes where it’s going, like, ‘Hey, here’s the next movie!’ In fact, I have no idea when or if we would return to that character in the movies.”
It turns out that Reeves’ had initially planned for Keoghan’s Joker to take a (slightly) bigger role in his film — only to almost cut Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
'” he says.
“I said to Barry, right from the beginning, ‘Look, I don’t know where this is going to go.
“Joaquin, as we were making the movie, had just won the Oscar.
“It’s something to think about with the Joker.
'” But Reeves also knew that if he announced Keoghan’s actual screen credit — “Unseen Arkham Inmate” — it wouldn’t take very long for fans to guess what he was up to.
And it’s already delicious.
So he cut it.
“It’s not about some version where he falls into a vat of chemicals and his face is distorted, or what [Christopher] Nolan did, where there’s some mystery to how he got these scars carved into his face,” he says.
“I never was trying to say like, ‘Hey, guess what, here’s the Joker.
They already thought you can’t do the Joker again after Heath Ledger.
“There might be places,” Reeves says.
It changed people’s response to the very ending of the movie, to see that Gotham was still Gotham, and that Batman really didn’t have a choice.
So Reeves shot a scene in which Batman snuck inside Arkham, arriving at the door of a specific inmate.
“We made a really concerted effort to make this different from the other ‘Batman’ movies, because we needed to,” he says.
Even though there have been “Batman” films for decades — this film is the ninth since Tim Burton’s “Batman” came out in 1989 — any devotion for the Dark Knight that those films have built in older moviegoers didn’t sway the early crowd away from the youth-heavy tilt that blockbusters from “Godzilla vs. Kong” to “No Way Home” showed all last year.
While the animated family film is aimed at a demographic far different from that of this bleak, violent DC film, it’s one less film that could peel away theatrical ticket sales from single millennials.

Traditionally, audience turnout for blockbusters gradually gets older in the later weeks of their theatrical run.
With $258 million already in the bank worldwide and strong word-of-mouth from critics and audiences, “The Batman” has a good chance to join “Spider-Man: No Way Home” as the second movie of the COVID era to gross over $1 billion worldwide on its reported $200 million budget.
Five years ago, Warner Bros.’ critically acclaimed “Wonder Woman” became the third-highest grossing film in North America in 2017 with $412 million.
But while it was still a hit, Patty Jenkins’ film fell short of $1 billion as overseas grosses failed to match those seen for “Batman” films like “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.”
But when Warner and DC put out a dark, gritty film set in Gotham City, audiences worldwide have shown they will turn out.
Globally, “The Batman” is off to a strong start on the road to $1 billion.
“Spider-Man: No Way Home” showed the power a blockbuster can have at the box office when it wins over the hearts and minds of audiences, even during a pandemic.
The U.K. was the top overseas market with $18.4 million, followed by Mexico with $12 million and Australia with $9.2 million.
Paramount+ Tops in U.S.
The film will be released in Japan this Friday and roll out additional markets in coming weeks.
That’s a big start to 2022 for Warner Bros., which is pivoting to a Disney-esque strategy of releasing fewer films per year with a greater emphasis on franchises.

Here are some of the factors that could boost Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne to blockbuster status.
With moviegoers over 35 largely staying home over the past year due to COVID-19 concerns, that hasn’t happened as much.
Though “The Batman” didn’t have a big crossover with past Bruce Waynes —
— it now has a fervent following that could bring in non-Batlovers the way Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy did.

But with the Omicron surge largely subsided and most states relaxing or lifting COVID-19 safety rules, we could see more Gen Xers and older millennials who grew up with Michael Keaton’s Batman movies or Christopher Nolan’s 2005-2012 trilogy showing up to see Matt Reeves’ take on Gotham’s protector.
“The Batman” has already joined “No Way Home” as only the second $100 million-plus opening since the pandemic began, and the first non-Disney/Marvel blockbuster to cross that mark since “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” in June 2018.
Opening weekend data showed that 78% of the audience for “The Batman” was under the age of 35, and approximately 60% were male.
Speaking of China, “The Batman” will get a release there on March 18 after many Hollywood blockbusters were denied by the country’s film board last year.

ANALYSIS.
While DC films have never made as much in China as their Marvel counterparts — “Batman v Superman” grossed just $95 million there — it’s another major market that will boost overseas numbers in the second half of the month.
“Barry was full in.
“It’s not about some version where he falls into a vat of chemicals and his face is distorted, or what [Christopher] Nolan did, where there’s some mystery to how he got these scars carved into his face,” he says.
In an early cut of “The Batman,” Keoghan actually showed up much earlier, in a scene following the revelation that the Riddler has killed the Gotham City police commissioner (before Jeffrey Wright’s Jim Gordon gets the job) and left behind yet another note addressed to the Batman.
But that was not anywhere close to his goal.
I don’t know.’ And I still feel that way now.
That, along with the fact that I loved him as an actor, was the deciding factor.
“You’re right,” Reeves says.
“And it was like an old Warner Bros. gangster movie and if you took a certain turn, you might see a character in his origins.”
That feeling is no better demonstrated than in the penultimate scene of the movie, after Dano’s Riddler has been locked up in Arkham Asylum, struck by despair that his grand plan to destroy Gotham has been foiled by Batman.
“It’s like ‘Phantom of the Opera,'” Reeves says.
“I didn’t want to create all this speculation that we were doing the Joker by naming what he was, so we thought, well, let’s make him be a cop, and then people won’t really think too hard about it,” he says.
So Reeves shot a scene in which Batman snuck inside Arkham, arriving at the door of a specific inmate.
“I didn’t want to call him the Joker,” Reeves says.
His face is half-covered through most of the film.” While it’s barely perceptible in the movie, Marino’s makeup evoked Veidt’s, giving Keoghan an unceasing rictus grin.
So Reeves and Marino turned to the original inspiration for the Joker: Conrad Veidt’s performance in the 1928 silent film “The Man Who Laughs,” based on a novel by Victor Hugo.
“There’s stuff I’m very interested in doing in an Arkham space, potentially for HBO Max.
Next movie!
There are things we’ve talked about there.
They already thought you can’t do the Joker again after Heath Ledger.
It’s already here.
It was a scene to unsettle him.”
Ultimately, however, Reeves felt that the scene hit the same beat accomplished elsewhere in the movie.
“It’s not an Easter egg scene,” he says.
“It’s something to think about with the Joker.
When he tested the movie, however, he realized that losing the Joker and Riddler’s
(to tweak a common phrase) affected the final scene of the film — in which Selina implores Batman to leave Gotham with her, knowing he’s fated to stay and fight for his city.
'” says Reeves.
As he wails in anguish, a voice from the cell next to his whispers from the door.
“You realize that they have a relationship, and that this guy obviously did something, and Batman somehow got him into Arkham.”
As they talk, Batman tells Joker he wants to know how Riddler thinks.
So I can imagine an actor going like, ‘There’s nowhere to go but down!
“And this guy says, ‘It’s almost our anniversary, isn’t it?
'” he says.
And we did it.”
Whether they’ll ever do it again will have to remain a tantalizing riddle for now.
So he put the Joker-Riddler scene back in.

“I was looking not only for somebody who was a good actor, but somebody who was fearless,” he says.
“I wanted him to be this kind of lean forward thing for people who were fans to go like, ‘Oh my god, I think that’s the Joker.
“The idea was more to say, ‘Hey, look, if you think that trouble is going to go away in Gotham, you can forget it.
Even as a child, people looked at him with horror, and his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.”
When Keoghan’s casting was announced, his character was presented as a Gotham City cop named Stanley Merkel who works with Jim Gordon.
“It’s not one of those end credits Marvel or DC scenes where it’s going, like, ‘Hey, here’s the next movie!’ In fact, I have no idea when or if we would return to that character in the movies.”
It turns out that Reeves’ had initially planned for Keoghan’s Joker to take a (slightly) bigger role in his film — only to almost cut Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
While Dano’s Riddler especially takes center stage in driving the story, Reeves also wanted to give audiences the feeling that other possible Batman villains could be lurking in the periphery, just out of the camera’s gaze.
“I thought he would be really insecure about this and he’d probably want to find some way to get into the [Riddler’s] mindset, like in ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Mindhunter’ — this idea of profiling somebody, so you can predict his next move,” says Reeves.
So he cut it.
He had this smile that people stared at that was grotesque and terrifying.
“I thought it’d be really neat if so much of the fabric of Gotham just already existed,” Reeves tells
.
Between the Riddler’s notes casting an uncomfortable spotlight on Batman and the discovery that the Riddler is killing city leaders neck-deep in corruption, Batman finds himself unnerved over what to make of what the Riddler is doing.
“I said, ‘The shape of his hair, the shape of his mouth, it’s all going to read, but it’s going to be soft,'” Reeves says of his conversation with Marino.
But he still worked with prosthetic makeup artist Michael Marino (“Coming 2 America”) to develop this Joker’s full look.
I think they’re doing the Joker.
“What is it they say?” the inmate says.

When director
sat down to conceive
he wanted to embrace the idea from the comics that as Bruce Wayne (
) found his footing as a costumed vigilante, he would inspire his eventual rogues gallery to take on their equally larger-than-life personas.
And then Joaquin comes in.
“Joaquin, as we were making the movie, had just won the Oscar.
It’s been done well, a number of times.”
When Reeves met with Keoghan about playing the Joker, he says he told the actor about his concerns.
You guys think the same.”
Reeves smiles.
“I said to Barry, right from the beginning, ‘Look, I don’t know where this is going to go.
And so that’s what that scene was.
“So he knew that was the canvas he had to deal with.”
With
many Jokers in cinema history, the trick was figuring out how to differentiate Keoghan’s look as the character from his predecessors.
It didn’t feel the same.” Reeves also didn’t like losing the final beat of the Riddler’s arc, in which, after a lifetime of neglect and isolation, he finally finds a compatriot — albeit a murderous psychopath.
And it’s already delicious.
It changed people’s response to the very ending of the movie, to see that Gotham was still Gotham, and that Batman really didn’t have a choice.
And he’s not yet the Joker — what’s this going to be?’ And then it seems so delicious in the story, since we’d already set him up, to have the end of the story, the completion of the Riddler arc, be that he was in a cell next to this guy.”
But when Reeves cut the first scene, he thought the second scene with the Riddler would need to go as well — cutting Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
“There might be places,” Reeves says.
The character, played by
(“Eternals,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”), is credited as “Unseen Arkham Inmate.” But any astute Batman fan — or, for that matter, Batman neophyte — will know who this inmate is meant to be.
“You kind of felt like, well,
It changed the emotional stakes.
“And I think it wasn’t just that people enjoyed seeing that character.
“I never was trying to say like, ‘Hey, guess what, here’s the Joker.
Alas, between leaks from test screenings and
the internet thought plenty hard about who Keoghan was playing well before “The Batman” debuted, and sleuthed out that he was, indeed, playing the Joker.
“It wasn’t necessary,” he says.
It also isn’t impossible, that there is some story that comes back where Joker comes into our world.”
By the same token, Reeves is acutely aware of the
memorable performances actors have given as the Joker, including by Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto, and — earning them both Oscars — Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix.
“It is the Joker.”
While it may seem obvious that Reeves placed this scene at the end of “The Batman” to set up Keoghan as the lead villain for the inevitable sequel, the director was quick to explain that not only was that
his intention, he is in no way convinced that Keoghan’s Joker will appear in any more “Batman” movies.
I’m not sure exactly.”
For that reason, Reeves wanted someone eager to take on the “high-wire act” of playing the Joker, even if the performance only ever ended up lasting a few scant minutes.
“He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific.
Whether Keoghan will
playing the Joker remains an open question.
Here’s everything the filmmaker had to say about the character and what his future could be within his “Batman” universe, including a possible HBO Max series about Arkham Asylum.
“That was the scene that was meant to introduce this guy and just to tease the audience to go like, ‘Oh my god,
here too?
“Because when Selena is saying to him, ‘This place is never going to change,’ you hadn’t seen that, in fact, trouble was already brewing,” Reeves says.
“It was one of those scenes where, given how complex the narrative was, by taking it out, it kept the story moving in a way it needed to.”
Cutting the first Joker scene was so heartbreaking that Reeves intends to release it once enough people have seen “The Batman.”
“It’s a really creepy, cool scene,” he says.
“We made a really concerted effort to make this different from the other ‘Batman’ movies, because we needed to,” he says.
“I initially tested it without it; when I put it back in, the scores for the ending went back up,” he says.
'”
To keep an air of mystery, and reinforce the idea that this Joker hasn’t fully
the Joker, Reeves decided to shoot both of Keoghan’s scenes with the actor’s face obscured and partially out of focus.
So it’s very possible.
Over the course of the film, that transformation commences for both villains — Paul Dano’s Riddler and Colin Farrell’s Penguin — as well as Batman’s quasi-partner in crimefighting, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), as she becomes Catwoman.
“One day you’re on top.
'”
Reeves chuckles.
“And [Batman] is resisting this idea violently.
I can’t promise that it’ll even ever come back.
Joker’s reply, as relayed by Reeves: “What do you mean, you want to know how he thinks?
Even for a character who has just minutes of screen time, Reeves wanted to ensure that his film’s Joker was imbued with a clear psychological motivation, so he also extrapolated what it would be like for a kid to be born with a condition in which he never stopped smiling.
'” But Reeves also knew that if he announced Keoghan’s actual screen credit — “Unseen Arkham Inmate” — it wouldn’t take very long for fans to guess what he was up to.
He has to keep doing what he’s gonna do.”
Reeves knows that introducing the Joker so close to the end of the movie will invariably lead audiences to expect to see more of him in the next film.
“What if this guy from birth had this disease and he was cursed?
“What he’s really doing is getting into Batman’s head,” he says.
The next, you’re a clown.” As the camera pulls back, Riddler and the inmate dissolve into laughter and a new, wicked friendship is born.
