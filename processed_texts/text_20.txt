Still too early, but think it could get to $19m.

If you can say anything about Utah, it's that it's unusual.
BTS is going to be like almost $7m
Holy guacamole
little over 67 is possible?
I blatantly did not mention Oscars and only the Letterboxd score for a reason
I don't think Batman is getting major Oscars, there?
Given the context it seemed like you were debunking a proposed link between LB and Oscar chances.

I agree!
talking about joker remember when it outgrossed TROS by 300k
What’s with the aggression?
11 oscars nominations for dc again
Come on.
What’s with the aggression?
Going to guess WB play it a bit safe with a 64M estimate which ends up being 66 on Monday actuals.
Feel free to read our
as well.
15% bump vs. yesterday at the same time.
Dude, i am not talking about Oscars.
If it hits 66 with actuals on Monday, that would lock 300M on next Sunday.
Looking right at $28m
$19m is back on the menu, boys.
#CINEMA
Hopefully they report those BTS figures, at $35 a pop the PTA must be huge
Looking right at $28m
BTS is going to be like almost $7m
Uncharted right around $4m
Nice number, probably hurted a bit because of the weather
Hopefully Sunday will be around 20M to compensate
$2.35m for Dog.
Sounds like you guys have some unusual daily patterns!
I was just pointing out Batman has a similar score as other recently acclaimed high profile comic book movies like Joker and No Way Home.
Because I didn't think i would be quoted numerous times about an offhand mention of a Letterboxd score.
Just the Letterboxd scores
You were directly replying to a comment amount the relationship between its letterboxd score and the Oscars

Come on.
Tbf Joker doesn’t exactly serve as a counter example for Oscar consideration.
The Batman could have (and may) garnered many secondary Oscar noms.
Better?
Will do about 24M on the weekdays and 40 on the weekend.
Just the Letterboxd scores
Dude, i am not talking about Oscars.
The best chance Batman has for major Oscars is WB to re-release in the fall and main it top campaign priority because all they have are Elvis which is dependent on box office and Don't Worry Darling which might be seen as genre play only.
Despite losing half of its showings in the biggest auditorium to BTS Permission to Dance (
)
It cracks me up that Disney sent its big budget animated Pixar film about boy band crazy tweens to its streaming service on the same weekend that a live recording of a boy band concert is playing in theaters.
