The Batman Sequel Could Include a "Grounded" Mr.

So, I love the fantastical side of Batman, but this iteration, obviously, while being, to me, I think it is very comics faithful, but I don't think that this one is necessarily, it doesn't lean as hard into the fantastical, I guess.
Apologies in advance.
So that doesn't nix the idea of the more ridiculous villains making an appearance — but don't expect anything like

But that isn't to say the more fantastical villains couldn't get involved, with one particularly cold character seemingly a favorite of his.
And unlike Peacemaker, Batman has a broader coiterie of super villains to face, from The Joker and Bane through to lesser known foes like Clayface and Man-Bat.

Now, more than a year

Even though he got

At the moment, Jared Leto is under no contractual obligations to play the Joker again, and the DCEU doesn't appear set to revisit the role in any of its upcoming movies.
Speaking with

Even considering the less-than-ideal hand he was dealt, Leto has spoken often about how much he loves bringing this iconic DC role to life.

As evidenced by the last few years, DC is never far away from bringing some version of the Joker into play on the big screen.
I know they’re not, of course, but I get attached.
But should Warner Bros. decide to bring Leto back as the pale-faced psychopath in another DC story, the man behind the clown

Whether it's the Joker or Morbius, he sees them as

“For me, they’re like living, breathing people.

And I got a chance to do it twice.”
When asked if he would be open to playing the role again
, Leto utilized a classic response in saying,
Leto is known for diving into the deep end with the roles he takes, which he feels in his heart after leaving them behind once shooting finishes.
Unfortunately, Leto's Joker didn't get a ton of material to work with, only seeing less than ten minutes of screen time in total

Right now, Leto's focus is on the Marvel world thanks to his leading role in

“I don’t know if it came directly from Chris Nolan,” she said.

“The Batman” star
suggested that racism was behind her being rejected for a role in a previous “Batman” movie.
“I think it was probably a casting director of some kind, or a casting director’s assistant.
...
Being a woman of color and being an actor and being told at that time that I wasn’t able to read because of the color of my skin, and the word urban being thrown around like that, that was what was really hard about that moment.”
Kravitz emphasized later Tuesday on Instagram that “The Dark Knight Rises” role she sought wasn’t for Catwoman — it was for “a small part” she didn’t specify.
Kravitz, who plays Catwoman in the current box-office hit headlined by Robert Pattinson as Batman,
this week that she tried to get an audition for director Chris Nolan’s 2012 “The Dark Knight Rises.”
But she said she was told she was too “urban."
“It was like, ‘What does that have to do with anything?’ I have to play the role like, ‘Yo, what’s up, Batman?
“The Dark Knight Rises” starred Christian Bale as the caped crusader and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, the feline-like villain.
What’s going on wit chu?’”
“The Batman,” directed by Matt Reeves,
in its premiere weekend, injecting hope into the Hollywood box office as the latest COVID-19 surge fades.

Kravitz, whose parents are musician Lenny Kravitz and actor Lisa Bonet, previously
on “The Dark Knight Rises.”
“They told me that I couldn’t get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren’t ‘going urban,’” she told the outlet.

Anyone who was hoping for a Tuesday bump is going to be disappointed.
Feel free to read our
as well.
Of course.
Let's see how Spring break affects things starting tomorrow, but I think a higher than expected Saturday jump and lower than expected Sunday drop and next weekdays behaving like Mid-May weekdays.
That moves me from like 57 to 61.5ish
How are the chances for the Bat to end up over
's DOM gross?
Do you guys think Dog can beat Gucci domestically?
BvS Thursday to weekend multiple gets it to 56.7M, 62-65M seems like a possible weekend.
I think weekday numbers will be hard on this one with the 3 hour run time and weekend numbers should hold up better.
2.84 multiplier; certainly seems possible given WoM seems to be more on the positive side.
$8.3m
Fantastic hold.
I think a lot of it depends on how it holds in April and how far it's gone by the time the 45 day window is over.
-0.2% from Wed!
2.84 would be a great multiplier.
That moves me from like 57 to 61.5ish
I’m going to go with $63m 2nd weekend.
It's obviously possible but I think it's going to come in just under.
I'm gonna say it does it.

Impending spring break would mean a likely increase for all holdovers.
The opening weekend gross of 134 includes all sneak previews doesn't it?
Dog $543,197 (-15% LW)

Well well, pretty nice.
It opened here in Toronto on the Wednesday so the weekend gross is definitely a bit inflated.
Hoping for $18M on Friday.
You never know.
Honestly these weekdays have been great.
I thought with the runtime it might struggle with weekdays and excel on weekends.
If it can push to 70 (highly unlikely) then it will definitely get to 400M, but with like a 62-65M, it will end around 375+
Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:
Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:
I would assume same calendar configuration = same dates for spring holidays.
Better Sun drops though
Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:
That's just how Thursdays used to be when there were no big openers.
Fri and Sat jumps will be prolly affected too.
70m 2nd weekend is a possibility?
I don't think it's going to pass dh2.
