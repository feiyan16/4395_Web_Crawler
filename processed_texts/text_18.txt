General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost
“The Batman” star
suggested that racism was behind her being rejected for a role in a previous “Batman” movie.
Kravitz, whose parents are musician Lenny Kravitz and actor Lisa Bonet, previously
on “The Dark Knight Rises.”
“They told me that I couldn’t get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren’t ‘going urban,’” she told the outlet.
What’s going on wit chu?’”
“The Batman,” directed by Matt Reeves,
in its premiere weekend, injecting hope into the Hollywood box office as the latest COVID-19 surge fades.
General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost
Being a woman of color and being an actor and being told at that time that I wasn’t able to read because of the color of my skin, and the word urban being thrown around like that, that was what was really hard about that moment.”
Kravitz emphasized later Tuesday on Instagram that “The Dark Knight Rises” role she sought wasn’t for Catwoman — it was for “a small part” she didn’t specify.
...
Kravitz, who plays Catwoman in the current box-office hit headlined by Robert Pattinson as Batman,
this week that she tried to get an audition for director Chris Nolan’s 2012 “The Dark Knight Rises.”
But she said she was told she was too “urban."
“I think it was probably a casting director of some kind, or a casting director’s assistant.
“The Dark Knight Rises” starred Christian Bale as the caped crusader and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, the feline-like villain.
“It was like, ‘What does that have to do with anything?’ I have to play the role like, ‘Yo, what’s up, Batman?
“I don’t know if it came directly from Chris Nolan,” she said.
“And it was like an old Warner Bros. gangster movie and if you took a certain turn, you might see a character in his origins.”
That feeling is no better demonstrated than in the penultimate scene of the movie, after Dano’s Riddler has been locked up in Arkham Asylum, struck by despair that his grand plan to destroy Gotham has been foiled by Batman.
“We made a really concerted effort to make this different from the other ‘Batman’ movies, because we needed to,” he says.
“And [Batman] is resisting this idea violently.
“I said, ‘The shape of his hair, the shape of his mouth, it’s all going to read, but it’s going to be soft,'” Reeves says of his conversation with Marino.
I’m not sure exactly.”
For that reason, Reeves wanted someone eager to take on the “high-wire act” of playing the Joker, even if the performance only ever ended up lasting a few scant minutes.
They already thought you can’t do the Joker again after Heath Ledger.
“It’s not one of those end credits Marvel or DC scenes where it’s going, like, ‘Hey, here’s the next movie!’ In fact, I have no idea when or if we would return to that character in the movies.”
It turns out that Reeves’ had initially planned for Keoghan’s Joker to take a (slightly) bigger role in his film — only to almost cut Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
“The idea was more to say, ‘Hey, look, if you think that trouble is going to go away in Gotham, you can forget it.
“I said to Barry, right from the beginning, ‘Look, I don’t know where this is going to go.
In an early cut of “The Batman,” Keoghan actually showed up much earlier, in a scene following the revelation that the Riddler has killed the Gotham City police commissioner (before Jeffrey Wright’s Jim Gordon gets the job) and left behind yet another note addressed to the Batman.
Here’s everything the filmmaker had to say about the character and what his future could be within his “Batman” universe, including a possible HBO Max series about Arkham Asylum.
So it’s very possible.
“Barry was full in.
“One day you’re on top.
I can’t promise that it’ll even ever come back.
“I thought it’d be really neat if so much of the fabric of Gotham just already existed,” Reeves tells
.
Alas, between leaks from test screenings and
the internet thought plenty hard about who Keoghan was playing well before “The Batman” debuted, and sleuthed out that he was, indeed, playing the Joker.
But he still worked with prosthetic makeup artist Michael Marino (“Coming 2 America”) to develop this Joker’s full look.
I think they’re doing the Joker.
“It was one of those scenes where, given how complex the narrative was, by taking it out, it kept the story moving in a way it needed to.”
Cutting the first Joker scene was so heartbreaking that Reeves intends to release it once enough people have seen “The Batman.”
“It’s a really creepy, cool scene,” he says.
'”
To keep an air of mystery, and reinforce the idea that this Joker hasn’t fully
the Joker, Reeves decided to shoot both of Keoghan’s scenes with the actor’s face obscured and partially out of focus.
“It’s not about some version where he falls into a vat of chemicals and his face is distorted, or what [Christopher] Nolan did, where there’s some mystery to how he got these scars carved into his face,” he says.
'”
Reeves chuckles.
It’s already here.
And we did it.”
Whether they’ll ever do it again will have to remain a tantalizing riddle for now.
“Because when Selena is saying to him, ‘This place is never going to change,’ you hadn’t seen that, in fact, trouble was already brewing,” Reeves says.
Even as a child, people looked at him with horror, and his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.”
When Keoghan’s casting was announced, his character was presented as a Gotham City cop named Stanley Merkel who works with Jim Gordon.
And then Joaquin comes in.
A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast
The Business of Entertainment
“What he’s really doing is getting into Batman’s head,” he says.
But that was not anywhere close to his goal.
'” But Reeves also knew that if he announced Keoghan’s actual screen credit — “Unseen Arkham Inmate” — it wouldn’t take very long for fans to guess what he was up to.
“I thought he would be really insecure about this and he’d probably want to find some way to get into the [Riddler’s] mindset, like in ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Mindhunter’ — this idea of profiling somebody, so you can predict his next move,” says Reeves.
Over the course of the film, that transformation commences for both villains — Paul Dano’s Riddler and Colin Farrell’s Penguin — as well as Batman’s quasi-partner in crimefighting, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), as she becomes Catwoman.
It also isn’t impossible, that there is some story that comes back where Joker comes into our world.”
By the same token, Reeves is acutely aware of the
memorable performances actors have given as the Joker, including by Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto, and — earning them both Oscars — Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix.
And he’s not yet the Joker — what’s this going to be?’ And then it seems so delicious in the story, since we’d already set him up, to have the end of the story, the completion of the Riddler arc, be that he was in a cell next to this guy.”
But when Reeves cut the first scene, he thought the second scene with the Riddler would need to go as well — cutting Keoghan out of the movie entirely.
Even for a character who has just minutes of screen time, Reeves wanted to ensure that his film’s Joker was imbued with a clear psychological motivation, so he also extrapolated what it would be like for a kid to be born with a condition in which he never stopped smiling.
When he tested the movie, however, he realized that losing the Joker and Riddler’s
(to tweak a common phrase) affected the final scene of the film — in which Selina implores Batman to leave Gotham with her, knowing he’s fated to stay and fight for his city.
I don’t know.’ And I still feel that way now.
“It is the Joker.”
While it may seem obvious that Reeves placed this scene at the end of “The Batman” to set up Keoghan as the lead villain for the inevitable sequel, the director was quick to explain that not only was that
his intention, he is in no way convinced that Keoghan’s Joker will appear in any more “Batman” movies.
The character, played by
(“Eternals,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”), is credited as “Unseen Arkham Inmate.” But any astute Batman fan — or, for that matter, Batman neophyte — will know who this inmate is meant to be.
There are things we’ve talked about there.
“You realize that they have a relationship, and that this guy obviously did something, and Batman somehow got him into Arkham.”
As they talk, Batman tells Joker he wants to know how Riddler thinks.
Between the Riddler’s notes casting an uncomfortable spotlight on Batman and the discovery that the Riddler is killing city leaders neck-deep in corruption, Batman finds himself unnerved over what to make of what the Riddler is doing.
His face is half-covered through most of the film.” While it’s barely perceptible in the movie, Marino’s makeup evoked Veidt’s, giving Keoghan an unceasing rictus grin.
“You’re right,” Reeves says.
And so that’s what that scene was.
He had this smile that people stared at that was grotesque and terrifying.
So he put the Joker-Riddler scene back in.
“You kind of felt like, well,
It changed the emotional stakes.
While Dano’s Riddler especially takes center stage in driving the story, Reeves also wanted to give audiences the feeling that other possible Batman villains could be lurking in the periphery, just out of the camera’s gaze.
It was a scene to unsettle him.”
Ultimately, however, Reeves felt that the scene hit the same beat accomplished elsewhere in the movie.
“I didn’t want to create all this speculation that we were doing the Joker by naming what he was, so we thought, well, let’s make him be a cop, and then people won’t really think too hard about it,” he says.
You guys think the same.”
Reeves smiles.
Whether Keoghan will
playing the Joker remains an open question.
'” says Reeves.
“I never was trying to say like, ‘Hey, guess what, here’s the Joker.
And it’s already delicious.
“It wasn’t necessary,” he says.
It changed people’s response to the very ending of the movie, to see that Gotham was still Gotham, and that Batman really didn’t have a choice.
“There’s stuff I’m very interested in doing in an Arkham space, potentially for HBO Max.
“What if this guy from birth had this disease and he was cursed?
“I didn’t want to call him the Joker,” Reeves says.
“There might be places,” Reeves says.
“It’s something to think about with the Joker.
“I was looking not only for somebody who was a good actor, but somebody who was fearless,” he says.
“It’s not an Easter egg scene,” he says.
“What is it they say?” the inmate says.
“And this guy says, ‘It’s almost our anniversary, isn’t it?
So Reeves shot a scene in which Batman snuck inside Arkham, arriving at the door of a specific inmate.
So he cut it.
Next movie!
“And I think it wasn’t just that people enjoyed seeing that character.
“Joaquin, as we were making the movie, had just won the Oscar.
“I wanted him to be this kind of lean forward thing for people who were fans to go like, ‘Oh my god, I think that’s the Joker.
As he wails in anguish, a voice from the cell next to his whispers from the door.
So I can imagine an actor going like, ‘There’s nowhere to go but down!
It’s been done well, a number of times.”
When Reeves met with Keoghan about playing the Joker, he says he told the actor about his concerns.
“I initially tested it without it; when I put it back in, the scores for the ending went back up,” he says.
So Reeves and Marino turned to the original inspiration for the Joker: Conrad Veidt’s performance in the 1928 silent film “The Man Who Laughs,” based on a novel by Victor Hugo.
Joker’s reply, as relayed by Reeves: “What do you mean, you want to know how he thinks?
“That was the scene that was meant to introduce this guy and just to tease the audience to go like, ‘Oh my god,
here too?
It didn’t feel the same.” Reeves also didn’t like losing the final beat of the Riddler’s arc, in which, after a lifetime of neglect and isolation, he finally finds a compatriot — albeit a murderous psychopath.
“It’s like ‘Phantom of the Opera,'” Reeves says.
He has to keep doing what he’s gonna do.”
Reeves knows that introducing the Joker so close to the end of the movie will invariably lead audiences to expect to see more of him in the next film.
That, along with the fact that I loved him as an actor, was the deciding factor.

When director
sat down to conceive
he wanted to embrace the idea from the comics that as Bruce Wayne (
) found his footing as a costumed vigilante, he would inspire his eventual rogues gallery to take on their equally larger-than-life personas.
The next, you’re a clown.” As the camera pulls back, Riddler and the inmate dissolve into laughter and a new, wicked friendship is born.
“He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific.
“So he knew that was the canvas he had to deal with.”
With
many Jokers in cinema history, the trick was figuring out how to differentiate Keoghan’s look as the character from his predecessors.
'” he says.
That’s a big start to 2022 for Warner Bros., which is pivoting to a Disney-esque strategy of releasing fewer films per year with a greater emphasis on franchises.
Matt Reeves’ film has Rotten Tomatoes scores of 85% for critics and 90% for audiences to go with an A- on CinemaScore and a 4.5/5 overall rating on Postrak.
“The Batman” has already joined “No Way Home” as only the second $100 million-plus opening since the pandemic began, and the first non-Disney/Marvel blockbuster to cross that mark since “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” in June 2018.
1.
Even though there have been “Batman” films for decades — this film is the ninth since Tim Burton’s “Batman” came out in 1989 — any devotion for the Dark Knight that those films have built in older moviegoers didn’t sway the early crowd away from the youth-heavy tilt that blockbusters from “Godzilla vs. Kong” to “No Way Home” showed all last year.
Traditionally, audience turnout for blockbusters gradually gets older in the later weeks of their theatrical run.
The film will be released in Japan this Friday and roll out additional markets in coming weeks.
That clearer runway could help “The Batman” leg out since the opening weekend demographics fit into the same trend that has been playing out for a year: For a tentpole to be successful in this COVID era, you have to win over Gen Z and millennials, especially male ones.

Warner Bros. DC film opened to a strong $259 million globally
After spending all of 2021 tinkering with its day-and-date HBO Max experiment, Warner Bros. has returned to theatrical exclusivity in a huge way with “The Batman,” which earned an impressive $134 million domestically during its opening weekend.
“Spider-Man: No Way Home” showed the power a blockbuster can have at the box office when it wins over the hearts and minds of audiences, even during a pandemic.

While the animated family film is aimed at a demographic far different from that of this bleak, violent DC film, it’s one less film that could peel away theatrical ticket sales from single millennials.
Unlike “Batman v Superman — Dawn of Justice,” which was met with tepid reception in 2016 and saw its numbers drop hard after opening weekend, “The Batman” should have strong legs throughout March with excellent

COMMUNITY.
But while it was still a hit, Patty Jenkins’ film fell short of $1 billion as overseas grosses failed to match those seen for “Batman” films like “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.”
But when Warner and DC put out a dark, gritty film set in Gotham City, audiences worldwide have shown they will turn out.
Speaking of China, “The Batman” will get a release there on March 18 after many Hollywood blockbusters were denied by the country’s film board last year.

Globally, “The Batman” is off to a strong start on the road to $1 billion.
INTEL.
Though “The Batman” didn’t have a big crossover with past Bruce Waynes —
— it now has a fervent following that could bring in non-Batlovers the way Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy did.
Here are some of the factors that could boost Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne to blockbuster status.
Opening weekend data showed that 78% of the audience for “The Batman” was under the age of 35, and approximately 60% were male.
With $258 million already in the bank worldwide and strong word-of-mouth from critics and audiences, “The Batman” has a good chance to join “Spider-Man: No Way Home” as the second movie of the COVID era to gross over $1 billion worldwide on its reported $200 million budget.
With moviegoers over 35 largely staying home over the past year due to COVID-19 concerns, that hasn’t happened as much.
While DC films have never made as much in China as their Marvel counterparts — “Batman v Superman” grossed just $95 million there — it’s another major market that will boost overseas numbers in the second half of the month.
The U.K. was the top overseas market with $18.4 million, followed by Mexico with $12 million and Australia with $9.2 million.

ACCESS.
“The Batman” will also benefit from the absence of Disney/Pixar’s “Turning Red” from most countries after it became a Disney+ exclusive.
2.
Between now and the release of “Morbius” on April 1, “The Batman” will be the only major film in theaters, giving it plenty of time to draw in the casual moviegoers that “The Suicide Squad,”
, couldn’t bring in last year.
But with the Omicron surge largely subsided and most states relaxing or lifting COVID-19 safety rules, we could see more Gen Xers and older millennials who grew up with Michael Keaton’s Batman movies or Christopher Nolan’s 2005-2012 trilogy showing up to see Matt Reeves’ take on Gotham’s protector.
