	Fantastic hold. Impending spring break would mean a likely increase for all holdovers. Hoping for $18M on Friday. 


	How are the chances for the Bat to end up over 
's DOM gross?


	Well well, pretty nice. That moves me from like 57 to 61.5ish

	2.84 multiplier; certainly seems possible given WoM seems to be more on the positive side. I think a lot of it depends on how it holds in April and how far it's gone by the time the 45 day window is over. I'm gonna say it does it.

	I’m going to go with $63m 2nd weekend. 


	Honestly these weekdays have been great. I thought with the runtime it might struggle with weekdays and excel on weekends.


	 


	I think this weekend might surprise a lot of us. 70m 2nd weekend is a possibility? You never know.

	It's beating it.


	The opening weekend gross of 134 includes all sneak previews doesn't it? It opened here in Toronto on the Wednesday so the weekend gross is definitely a bit inflated. I don't think it's going to pass dh2. 2.84 would be a great multiplier. It's obviously possible but I think it's going to come in just under.


	-0.2% from Wed! 


	Uncharted - $935K (+13% || -14%) 


	No Way Home - $400K (+6 || -14%)

	Let's see how Spring break affects things starting tomorrow, but I think a higher than expected Saturday jump and lower than expected Sunday drop and next weekdays behaving like Mid-May weekdays.


	 


	BvS Thursday to weekend multiple gets it to 56.7M, 62-65M seems like a possible weekend. 


	 


	If it can push to 70 (highly unlikely) then it will definitely get to 400M, but with like a 62-65M, it will end around 375+


	Looking back it seems like increases are typical for Th mar 10, no idea why though:

	I would assume same calendar configuration = same dates for spring holidays. Fri and Sat jumps will be prolly affected too. Better Sun drops though

	That's just how Thursdays used to be when there were no big openers. Here's 2010:

	OTOH in 2013 when there was a biggish opener with previews:

						Anyone who was hoping for a Tuesday bump is going to be disappointed.  I think weekday numbers will be hard on this one with the 3 hour run time and weekend numbers should hold up better.
