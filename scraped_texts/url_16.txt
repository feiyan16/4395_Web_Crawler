“The Batman” star 
 suggested that racism was behind her being rejected for a role in a previous “Batman” movie.
Kravitz, who plays Catwoman in the current box-office hit headlined by Robert Pattinson as Batman, 
this week that she tried to get an audition for director Chris Nolan’s 2012 “The Dark Knight Rises.”
But she said she was told she was too “urban."
“I don’t know if it came directly from Chris Nolan,” she said. “I think it was probably a casting director of some kind, or a casting director’s assistant. ... Being a woman of color and being an actor and being told at that time that I wasn’t able to read because of the color of my skin, and the word urban being thrown around like that, that was what was really hard about that moment.”
Kravitz emphasized later Tuesday on Instagram that “The Dark Knight Rises” role she sought wasn’t for Catwoman — it was for “a small part” she didn’t specify.
“The Dark Knight Rises” starred Christian Bale as the caped crusader and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, the feline-like villain.
Kravitz, whose parents are musician Lenny Kravitz and actor Lisa Bonet, previously 
 on “The Dark Knight Rises.”
“They told me that I couldn’t get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren’t ‘going urban,’” she told the outlet. “It was like, ‘What does that have to do with anything?’ I have to play the role like, ‘Yo, what’s up, Batman? What’s going on wit chu?’”
“The Batman,” directed by Matt Reeves, 
 in its premiere weekend, injecting hope into the Hollywood box office as the latest COVID-19 surge fades.
