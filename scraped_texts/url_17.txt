 total for opening weekend came in at 
, per the studio (up $4.2M from Sunday’s projection). Combined with 
 of $134M through yesterday, this brings the global debut on the 
-starrer to 
 — a nearly $10M increase on the Sunday estimates.
With the updated figures, like-for-like overseas comps at today’s rates have moved in 
‘s favor. The opening is now 5% below 
, 14% ahead of

There were slight shifts in individual market cumes within the Top 5 which includes the

 at $9.3M, 
 with $8.8M and 
 at $8.4M.
Sunday’s benchmarks stand, with the Matt Reeves-directed take on the Caped Crusader the top international opening of 2022, WB’s best pandemic-era bow offshore and its best internationally since 
 in October 2019; as well as the 3rd biggest overseas pandemic-era debut in like-for-like markets behind

 edged Bruce Wayne).
Japan releases this coming Friday, followed by China on March 18. See below for how this first weekend rolled out.

 start, the global launch is 
.
The Matt Reeves-directed 
 was No. 1 in 73 of its openings, and came in at the high end of the 
 we were seeing ahead of the weekend. The international start is the industry’s best for 2022 (No. 3 for the pandemic when backing out China and Russia) and the biggest for Warner Bros since 
 in 2019, as well as the top international bow ever for Reeves.
While this is WB’s first time out domestically in a purely theatrical play after its HBO Max day-and-date pandemic strategy, that was never a factor overseas as films unspooled only in cinemas abroad throughout, kicking off early in many cases to avoid piracy issues. 
’s performance is again great news for the offshore theatrical business — when the product is there, audiences will come, particularly for a gripping, buzzy title and even despite its three-hour running time.
	
 should have wings going forward — Japan opens this coming Friday while China follows on March 18 and there is plenty of runway until Sony’s 
 gets its fangs out at the end of March.
In notable performances for the Caped Crusader, the UK and France benefited from having talent travel to the markets — a promotional factor that has been sorely missed during the pandemic. Australia also did great business even despite flooding in the eastern part of the country and new Covid restrictions in the west. Latin America, which loves DC, went batty for Robert Pattinson’s brooding turn in the suit. If there was slight weakness, it was in Asia where Korea has been battling an omicron spike.

As ever, once we get into the weekend everywhere, we’ll have a better outlook.
