Not to mention, the logistics of its lengthy running time meant that theater operators had to limit the number of showtimes per day.
It’s the kind of slate that should have movie theaters sizzling.
COVID continues to drop and warmer weather is coming — momentum should build now.”
That’s certainly the hope since Hollywood is keeping the summer schedule stacked with Jared Leto’s anti-hero adventure “Morbius” (April 1), Marvel’s “Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness” (May 6), “Top Gun: Maverick” (May 27) and “Jurassic World Dominion” (June 10).
Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, praised the assortment of genres — superhero, comedy, family, action, romantic comedy — on box office charts.
Since “The Batman,” directed by Matt Reeves, notched a PG-13 rating rather than R, the film was able to capture the key demographic of younger males, who have been fueling the domestic box office’s wobbly recovery.
That bodes well for its run on the big screen.
The third Spidey installment with Holland brought in $4.4 million over the weekend, boosting its domestic tally to a towering $786.4 million.
After four weekends on the big screen, the movie has earned just $37.1 million in North America.
Yet “Uncharted,” which is still playing in theaters, managed to bring in solid business despite the outsized attention for “The Batman.” In second place, the Sony Pictures film pocketed $11 million from 3,875 theaters between Friday and Sunday, pushing “Uncharted” past $100 million at the domestic box office.
Warner Bros. pulled the movie’s release in Russia following the country’s invasion of Ukraine last week.
In addition to Pattinson, “The Batman” stars Paul Dano as the Riddler, Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Andy Serkis as Batman’s butler Alfred Pennyworth and Colin Farrell as a crime lord known as Penguin.
More than 65% of opening weekend crowds were male, and more than 60% were between 18 and 34 years old.
The road-trip buddy comedy is somewhat of an anomaly because it has managed to entice audiences without involving superheroes or intense CG-action sequences.
“The Batman” did especially solid sales on Imax screens, which accounted for $22.3 million of the film’s global total.
Elsewhere, Channing Tatum’s canine adventure “Dog” landed at No.
“The Batman,” based on a far more ubiquitous property, beat that benchmark after earning $57 million on opening day alone.
“The Batman” lands on HBO Max in 45 days.
Other movies in the top 10 include Universal’s animated musical sequel “Sing 2” ($1.5 million over the weekend, $153 million to date), Paramount’s slapstick adventure “Jackass Forever” ($1.3 million over the weekend, $54.4 million to date) and director Joe Wright’s romantic drama “Cyrano” ($680,00 over the weekend, $2.5 million to date).
Of course, it helps that “The Batman” has the glittery promise of a former “Twilight” heartthrob taking on one of the most famous comic book characters in history.
In an especially rare feat, “No Way Home” has managed to stay within the top five on domestic rankings since the film premiered in December.
It helps that the word of mouth is so strong.”
“The Batman” also likely benefitted because the comic book adaptation is playing exclusively in theaters.
For Warner Bros., which opted to debut its entire 2021 theatrical film slate simultaneously on HBO Max, “The Batman” marks a deviation as the studio’s first movie since Christoper Nolan’s twisty thriller “Tenet “(which coincidentally also starred Pattinson) that’s only available to watch in cinemas.
It’s impossible to know the exact box office impact of putting movies day-and-date on streaming, but “The Batman” has generated more money in its opening weekend than any other Warner Bros. pandemic-era releases grossed in their entire theatrical runs.
“Uncharted” carries a $120 million price tag.

Thanks to positive reviews, strong reception from ticket buyers and high levels of intrigue to see Pattinson’s moody take on the Caped Crusader, “The Batman” is shaping up to be a commercial winner for Warner Bros. That’s good news because the studio shelled out a hefty $200 million to produce the film and spent many millions more in marking and distribution costs.
